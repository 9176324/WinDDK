Routine Description:

    This routine is a callback into the miniport to retrieve information about
    the guids being registered.

    This callback is synchronous and may not be pended. Also
	ScsiPortWmiPostProcess should not be called from within this callback.

Arguments:

    DeviceContext is a caller specified context value originally passed to
        ScsiPortWmiDispatchFunction.

    RequestContext is a context associated with the srb being processed.

    MofResourceName returns with a pointer to a WCHAR string with name of
        the MOF resource attached to the miniport binary image file. If
        the driver does not have a mof resource attached then this can
        be returned as NULL.

Return Value:

    TRUE if request is pending else FALSE

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is a callback into the miniport to query for the contents of
    one or more instances of a data block. This callback may be called with
    an output buffer that is too small to return all of the data queried.
    In this case the callback is responsible to report the correct output
	buffer size needed.

    If the request can be completed immediately without pending,
	ScsiPortWmiPostProcess should be called from within this callback and
    FALSE returned.
		
    If the request cannot be completed within this callback then TRUE should
    be returned. Once the pending operations are finished the miniport should
    call ScsiPortWmiPostProcess and then complete the srb.

Arguments:

    DeviceContext is a caller specified context value originally passed to
        ScsiPortWmiDispatchFunction.

    RequestContext is a context associated with the srb being processed.

    GuidIndex is the index into the list of guids provided when the
        miniport registered

    InstanceIndex is the index that denotes first instance of the data block
        is being queried.

    InstanceCount is the number of instances expected to be returned for
        the data block.

    InstanceLengthArray is a pointer to an array of ULONG that returns the
        lengths of each instance of the data block. This may be NULL when
        there is not enough space in the output buffer to fufill the request.
        In this case the miniport should call ScsiPortWmiPostProcess with
        a status of SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN and the size of the output buffer
        needed to fufill the request.

    BufferAvail on entry has the maximum size available to write the data
        blocks in the output buffer. If the output buffer is not large enough
        to return all of the data blocks then the miniport should call
        ScsiPortWmiPostProcess with a status of SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN
        and the size of the output buffer needed to fufill the request.

    Buffer on return is filled with the returned data blocks. Note that each
        instance of the data block must be aligned on a 8 byte boundry. This
        may be NULL when there is not enough space in the output buffer to
        fufill the request. In this case the miniport should call
        ScsiPortWmiPostProcess with a status of SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN and
        the size of the output buffer needed to fufill the request.

Routine Description:

    InstanceIndex is the index that denotes which instance of the data block
        is being set.

Routine Description:

    This routine is a callback into the miniport to execute a method.

    If the request can be completed immediately without pending,
	ScsiPortWmiPostProcess should be called from within this callback and
    FALSE returned.
		
    If the request cannot be completed within this callback then TRUE should
    be returned. Once the pending operations are finished the miniport should
    call ScsiPortWmiPostProcess and then complete the srb.

Arguments:

    Context is a caller specified context value originally passed to
        ScsiPortWmiDispatchFunction.

    RequestContext is a context associated with the srb being processed.

    GuidIndex is the index into the list of guids provided when the
        miniport registered

    InstanceIndex is the index that denotes which instance of the data block
        is being called.

    MethodId has the id of the method being called

    InBufferSize has the size of the data block passed in as the input to
        the method.

    OutBufferSize on entry has the maximum size available to write the
        returned data block. If the output buffer is not large enough
        to return all of the data blocks then the miniport should call
        ScsiPortWmiPostProcess with a status of SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN
        and the size of the output buffer needed to fufill the request.
        It is important to check that there is sufficient room in the
        output buffer before performing any operations that may have
        side effects.

    Buffer on entry has the input data block and on return has the output
        output data block.

Routine Description:

    This routine is a callback into the miniport to enabled or disable event
    generation or data block collection. Since WMI manages reference counting
    for each of the data blocks or events, a miniport should only expect a
	single enable followed by a single disable. Data blocks will only
    receive collection enable/disable if they were registered as requiring
    it, that is include the WMIREG_FLAG_EXPENSIVE flag.

    If the request can be completed immediately without pending,
	ScsiPortWmiPostProcess should be called from within this callback and
    FALSE returned.
		
    If the request cannot be completed within this callback then TRUE should
    be returned. Once the pending operations are finished the miniport should
    call ScsiPortWmiPostProcess and then complete the srb.

Arguments:

    DeviceContext is a caller specified context value originally passed to
        ScsiPortWmiDispatchFunction.

    RequestContext is a context associated with the srb being processed.

Routine Description:


    This routine will do the work of post-processing a WMI srb.

Arguments:

    RequestContext is a context associated with the srb being processed. After
        this api returns the ReturnStatus and ReturnSize fields are updated.

    SrbStatus has the return status code for the srb. If a query or method
        callback was passed an output buffer that was not large enough
        then SrbStatus should be SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN and BufferUsed
        should be the number of bytes needed in the output buffer.

    BufferUsed has the number of bytes required by the miniport to return the
       data requested in the WMI srb. If SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN was passed
       in SrbStatus then BufferUsed has the number of needed in the output
       buffer. If SRB_STATUS_SUCCESS is passed in SrbStatus then BufferUsed
       has the actual number of bytes used in the output buffer.
