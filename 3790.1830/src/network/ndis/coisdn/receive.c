@module Receive.c |

    This module implements the Miniport packet receive routines.  Basically,
    the asynchronous receive processing routine.  This module is very
    dependent on the hardware/firmware interface and should be looked at
    whenever changes to these interfaces occur.

@topic 3.4 Receiving Packets |

    A connection-oriented miniport or MCM calls NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket to
    indicate one or more received packets up to a connection-oriented client or
    call manager. If the miniport or MCM handles interrupts, it calls
    NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket from its MiniportHandleInterrupt function.

@normal

    In the call to NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket, the miniport or MCM passes a
    pointer to an array of packet descriptor pointers. The miniport or MCM also
    passes an NdisVcHandle that identifies the VC on which the packets were
    received. Before calling NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket, the miniport or MCM
    must set up a packet array (see Part 2, Section 4.6). 

    The call to NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket causes NDIS to call the
    ProtocolCoReceivePacket function of the protocol driver (connection-oriented
    client or call manager) that shares the indicated VC with the miniport. The
    ProtocolCoReceivePacket function processes the receive indication.

    After some miniport-determined number of calls to
    NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket, the miniport must call NdisMCoReceiveComplete
    to indicate the completion of the previous receive indications made with one
    or more calls to NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket. The call to
    NdisMCoReceiveComplete causes NDIS to call the ProtocolReceiveComplete
    function of the connection-oriented client or call manager.

    If a protocol does not return the miniport-allocated resources for a receive
    indication promptly enough, the miniport or MCM can call
    NdisMCoIndicateStatus with NDIS_STATUS_RESOURCES to alert the offending
    protocol that the miniport or MCM is running low on available packet or
    buffer descriptors (or even on NIC receive buffer space) for subsequent
    receive indications.

    <f ReceivePacketHandler> is called from <f MiniportTimer> to handle
    a packet receive event.  We enter here with interrupts enabled on

@comm

    We loop in here until all the available incoming packets have been passed
    up to the protocol stack.  As we find each good packet, it is passed up
    to the protocol stack using <f NdisMWanIndicateReceive>.  When NDIS
    returns control from this call, we resubmit the packet to the adapter
    so it can be used to receive another incoming packet.  The link flag
    <p NeedReceiveCompleteIndication> is set TRUE if any packets are received
    on a particular link.  This is used later, before returning from the
    async event handler, to notify NDIS of any ReceiveCompleteIndications.

@func

    <f MiniportReturnPacket> is a required function in drivers that
    indicate receives with NdisMIndicateReceivePacket.

@comm

    A miniport driver of a busmaster DMA NIC that supports multipacket
    receives and a miniport driver that supplies media-specific information,
    such as packet priorities, with its receive indications must have a
    MiniportReturnPacket function. An NDIS intermediate driver that binds
    itself to such a miniport driver also must have a MiniportReturnPacket
    function.

    Any packet with associated NDIS_PACKET_OOB_DATA in which the Status is set
    to NDIS_STATUS_PENDING on return from NdisMIndicateReceivePacket will be
    returned to MiniportReturnPacket. When all bound protocols have called
    NdisReturnPackets as many times as necessary to release their references
    to the originally indicated packet array, NDIS returns pended packets from
    the array to the MiniportReturnPacket function of the driver that
    originally allocated the packet array.

    Usually, MiniportReturnPacket prepares such a returned packet to be used
    in a subsequent receive indication. Although MiniportReturnPacket could
    return the buffer descriptors chained to the packet to buffer pool and the
    packet descriptor itself to packet pool, it is far more efficient to reuse
    returned descriptors.

    MiniportReturnPacket must call NdisUnchainBufferAtXxx as many times as
    necessary to save the pointers to all chained buffer descriptors before it
    calls NdisReinitializePacket. Otherwise, MiniportReturnPacket cannot
    recover the buffer descriptors the driver originally chained to the packet
    for the indication.

    MiniportReturnPacket also can call NdisZeroMemory with the pointer
    returned by NDIS_OOB_DATA_FROM_PACKET to prepare the packet's associated
    out-of-band block for reuse.

    If a particular buffer descriptor was shortened to match the size of an
    indicated range of data, MiniportReturnPacket should call
    NdisAdjustBufferLength with that buffer descriptor to restore its mapping
    of the NIC's receive buffer range.

    By default, MiniportReturnPacket runs at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL.

@rdesc

    <f MiniportReturnPacket> returns zero if it is successful.<nl>
    Otherwise, a non-zero return value indicates an error condition.
