;
; Follow this format for non-PNP adapters ISA
;
; Follow the txtsetup.oem in initio for PNP adapters like PCI and ISAPNP
;
; Txtsetup.oem is a generic way to install Storage adapters to get them through
; textmode setup.  Do as little as possible and allow GUI mode setup to do the 
; remaining work using the supplied inf.
;
; General format:
;
; [section]
; key = value1,value2,...
;
;
; The hash ('#') or semicolon (';') introduces a comment.
; Strings with embedded spaces, commas, or hashes should be double-quoted
;


; This section lists all disks in the disk set.
;
; <description> is a descriptive name for a disk, used when
;   prompting for the disk
; <tagfile> is a file whose presence allows setup to recognize
;   that the disk is inserted.
; <directory> is where the files are located on the disk.

[Disks]
d1 = "OEM DISK (SCSI)",\disk1,\

; This section lists the default selection for each 'required'
; hardware component.  If a line is not present for a component,
; the default defaults to the first item in the [<component_name>]
; section (see below).
;
; <component_name> is one of computer, display, keyboard, mouse, scsi
; <id> is a unique <within the component> string to be associated
;   with an option.

scsi = OEMSCSI


; This section lists the options available for a particular component.
;
; <id> is the unique string for the option
; <description> is a text string, presented to the user in a menu
; <key_name> gives the name of the key to be created for the component in
;   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ControlSet001\Services

; This section lists the files that should be copied if the user
; selects a particular component option.
;
; <file_type> is one of driver, port, class, dll, hal, inf, or detect.
;   See below.
; <source_disk> identifies where the file is to be copied from, and must
;   match en entry in the [Disks] section.
; <filename> is the name of the file. This will be appended to the
;   directory specified for the disk in the [Disks] section to form the
;   full path of the file on the disk.
; <driverkey> this is the name that will show under the services\driver key
; this should be the same name as the driver that is being installed.

; This section specifies values to be set in the registry for
; particular component options.  Required values in the services\xxx
; key are created automatically -- use this section to specify additional
; keys to be created in services\xxx and values in services\xxx and

;
; This section must be filled out for storage controllers that 
; are PNP adapters like PCI and ISA PNP adapters.  Failure to do this 
; can cause the driver to fail to load. Must also add the section
; [HardwareIds.scsi.ID] to identify the supported ID's.
;
; <value_name> specifies the value to be set within the key
; <value_type> is a string like REG_DWORD.  See below.
; <value> specifies the actual value; its format depends on <value_type>
