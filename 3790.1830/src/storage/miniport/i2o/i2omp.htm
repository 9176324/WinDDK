<H2> I2OMP StorPort Miniport Sample </H2>
<H3> SUMMARY </H3>
<P>
This directory contains the storport miniport driver supporting a variety of I2O Controllers.
It exports functions that are used by storport.sys to issue requests to the underlying RAID Set(s)
and pass-through devices, such as tape and CD-ROM drives.

This driver illustrates the use of the new storport functionality to create a fully-featured
storport miniport driver.
</P>

<H3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</H3>
<P>
To build the sample, run the <B>build</B> command. This will produce i2omp.sys.
As storport.sys was not included with earlier versions Microsoft(R) Windows(R) operating systems,
Windows Server 2003 and later are required to use this miniport.

</P>

<H3>RESOURCES</H3>
<P>
More information concerning STORPORT miniports can be found in the Windows Server 2003 DDK.
