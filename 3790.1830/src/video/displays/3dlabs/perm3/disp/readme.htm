</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>


<H3>SUMMARY</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
This is a display driver for graphics adapters based
on the 3Dlabs Permedia-3 chipset. 
It supports GDI acceleration, Microsoft DirectDraw&#174; acceleration, Microsoft Direct3D&#174; acceleration,
and multiple monitor support.

This display driver forms a matched pair with the 3Dlabs Permedia3 video miniport driver. The miniport driver is responsible for non-rendering tasks such as adapter initialization, register mapping, and other resource allocation, whereas the display driver handles actual rendering tasks.<p>

This sample driver runs on Windows® 2000/XP/Server 2003 on the X86/IA64 platform.<P>

The driver is compiled as a DX9 driver and currently supports pointsprites, multisampling, volume textures, DX8 multistreaming (with a single stream), DX9 scissor rect, DX9 antialiased line, DX9 DP2 BLT, DX9 color-converted presentation, DX9 lightweight mipmap and DX9 auto-generated mipmap. 

<H3>RELEASE NOTES</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
