<p>This sample demonstrates basic Isochronous IO under WDM with the Intel i82930 
USB controller. <br>
<br>
See the document for the corresponding Bulk IO sample, &quot;BulkUsb.Doc&quot; for 
discussion of basic architechtural issues,as well as Plug and Play and Power 
Management IRP handling, as it is basically the same as in this sample.<br>
<br>
The accompanying console test application for IsoUsb.Sys, RwIso.Exe, operates 
similarly to RwBulk.Exe, the console test app for BulkUsb.sys. See BulkUsb.Doc.</p>
<p>Installing IsoUsb.sys<br>
---------------------</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make an 'OEM installation diskette' or equivalent installation source 
  directory for IsoUsb.sys by copying IsoUsb.sys and IsoUsb.inf into it.The 
  sample IsoUsb.Inf is in the DDK IsoUsb\Sys source directory. </li>
  <li>Make sure your device has been programmed with the device VID/PID in the 
  IsoUsb.inf file. If not, edit the device VID, PID, and description text to 
  match your test board/device.</li>
  <li>Depending on the operating system you are using:</li>
</ol>
<p>On Windows 2000:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When you plug in the device, the &quot;Found New Hardware Wizard&quot; dialog box 
  will appear with the subheading &quot;Install Hardware Device Drivers&quot;. Hit the 
  radio button labelled &quot;Search for a suitable driver for your device 
  (Recommended)&quot; and then hit the &quot;Next&quot; button. The following screen has you 
  specify your installation source floppy or directory. Do so, then hit the 
  &quot;Next&quot; button. The next screen should indicate that Windows 2000 is ready to 
  install the driver. Near the middle of the box, you should see the full source 
  path to IsoUsb.Inf. Hit the &quot;Next&quot; button. You'll briefly see a &quot;copying 
  Files&quot; message box, then once again the &quot;Found New Hardware Wizard&quot; box, now 
  displaying the subheading, &quot;Hardware Install: The hardware installation is 
  complete&quot;. Hit the &quot;Finish&quot; button. You should now have a copy of IsoUsb.Sys 
  in your \System32\Drivers directory, a IsoUsb.Inf in your \Winnt\Inf 
  directory, and a newly-created IsoUsb.Pnf file, which is a precompiled setup 
  info file that Windows 2000 creates. If the final &quot;Add New Hardware Wizard&quot; 
  box indicates any error, or if the OS says you must reboot to finish 
  installation of this device, something has gone wrong. Check your Inf file, 
  Install directory, or driver code, follow the instructions in the below 
  section on simulating a 'first-time' install, and start over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Win98: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Plug in the device. The &quot;Add New Hardware Wizard&quot; dialog box will appear, 
  indicating that &quot;This wizard searches for new drivers for: [your deviceName as 
  programmed into your board's hardware]. Hit the &quot;Next&quot; button. On the 
  following screen, hit the radio button labelled &quot;Search for the best driver 
  for your device (Recommended)&quot; . Hit the &quot;Next&quot; button. The next screen has 
  you specify your installation source floppy or directory. Do so, then hit the 
  &quot;Next&quot; button. The next screen should indicate that Windows is ready to 
  install the driver. You should see the full source path to IsoUsb.Inf under 
  the label: &quot;Location of Driver&quot;. Hit the &quot;Next&quot; button. You will see the 
  &quot;Building Driver Information Database&quot; message box, then, if the installation 
  and loading of the driver have succeeded, you will see the final wizard box 
  saying &quot; Windows has finished installing the software that your new hardware 
  device requires.&quot; Hit the &quot;Finish&quot; button. If the final &quot;Add New Hardware 
  Wizard&quot; box indicates any error, or if the OS says you must reboot to finish 
  installation of this device, something has gone wrong. Check your Inf file, 
  Install directory,or driver code, follow the below instructions on simulating 
  a 'first-time' install, and start over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Updating the Driver<br>
-------------------</p>
<p>To install a new version of your driver after a successful initial 
installation, simply replace the binary in \System32\Drivers. If the initial or 
last installation failed for any reason, follow the below instructions on 
simulating a 'first-time' install.</p>
<p><br>
Simulating a 'First-time' Install <br>
-------------------------------<br>
If you want to test Inf file or installation program modifications, or if your 
first install failed for any reason and you need to do, in effect, a new 
'first-time' driver installation without reinstalling a fresh Win98 or Windows 
2000, do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Delete IsoUsb.inf from the \Windows\Inf or \Winnt\Inf directory. On Winnt, 
  also delete IsoUsb.PNF from the \Winnt\Inf directory.</li>
  <li>Delete IsoUsb.Sys from the \System32\Drivers directory.</li>
  <li>Using RegEdit on Win98, or RegEdt32 on Windows 2000, purge the registry of 
  the following driver information:</li>
</ol>
<p>For Windows 98: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Delete the following registry key:<br>
  \LocalMachine\System\Enum\USB\[the key with your device ID/PID], <br>
  ( in the case of our sample as published, this would be:<br>
  \LocalMachine\System\Enum\USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_930A )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Windows 2000:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Delete the following registry key:<br>
  \LocalMachine\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB\[the key with your deviceId/PID]<br>
  On Windows 2000, you must restart the system before reinstalling the driver; 
  this is not neccesary on Win98.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
IsoUsb.Inf is in the Sys subdirectory.</p>
<p>It allows you to set registry overrides for:</p>
<p>&quot;DebugLevel&quot; debug verbosity level, where 0 == no debug output, 1 == default 
, higher == more verbose.</p>
