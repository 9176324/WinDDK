<P><b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="font-size:9.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Abstract:
</span></i></b>This document accompanies the redistributable co-installer that
can be used to build an INF file that can be used to copy multiple INF files.
This binary is to support the CopyINF directive on the Microsoft® Windows®
2000 operating system. Support for the <b>CopyINF</b> directive discussed in
this document is built into the Windows XP operating system, so this co-installer need not be used in an INF section targeted for only Windows
XP. The co-installer must not be used when installing on a 64-bit platform.<H3>SUMMARY</H3>
This document accompanies and describes a redistributable
co-installer that can be used to install additional device INF files on the
target system during a device installation. The instructions provided herein
apply to the Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows XP operating systems.
<p>
The co-installer described in this article interprets <b>CopyINF</b>
directives in a [<i>DDInstall</i>] section in an INF file. Using <b>CopyINF</b>
together with this co-installer allows for one INF file to copy multiple INF
files to the target system.
<p>
This technique is useful, for example, when installing a
multifunction device. Using this method, the base INF file for a multifunction
device could list the INF files for the individual functions of the devices in a
<b>CopyINF</b> directive and install the co-installer, which would then install
the referenced INF files for the individual functions.
<p>The syntax of the <b>CopyINF</b> directive is:
<p style="margin-left:.25in">[<em>DDInstall</em>]<br>
<b>CopyINF =</b> <em>filename.inf</em><i>[,</i><em>filename2.inf]</em>...

<p>The source code for this co-installer and two sample INF files
are available at &lt;ddkroot&gt;\src\setup\cocpyinf and &lt;ddkroot&gt;\src\setup\cocpyinf\install
respectively.

<p><b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">The INF copying functionality demonstrated in this
    example is not necessary for Windows XP, which includes built-in
    support for the <b>CopyINF</b> directive. However it is recommended for an
    INF that may be installed on Windows® 2000. For an installation that may 
    include a 64-bit platform, decorated sections should be used to ensure that 
    this co-installer is not installed and used on a 64-bit platform as native 
    platform co-installers must be used.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">Windows 2000 and Windows XP Setup expect the
    locations of INF files specified in the <b>CopyINF</b> directive to be
    relative to the source location of the INF in which they are specified.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">The INF file copy occurs after the device has been 
    installed. Windows 2000 and Windows XP Setup assume that the source
    media is still available. Therefore, be sure to include all INF files on
    each disk of a multi-disk installation package.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">If the current INF file name and the original INF
    file name are different, then CoCpyInf assumes the INF has already been
    copied and will not perform the file copies.
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When a device installation from a third-party INF occurs, that
INF is copied to the system INF directory under a unique OEM<i>&lt;n&gt;</i>.inf 
name. The co-installer determines whether the additional <b>CopyINF</b>
actions are necessary, depending on whether the INF’s original name differs
from its current name. If the two names are the same, then the INF has not yet
been installed into the INF directory, so the additional INF files are copied.
If the INF’s original and current names differ, this indicates installation is
from a third-party INF that already resides in the INF directory. In that case,
the additional INF copy operations do not need to be performed, because they
would have been copied previously.

<p>Attempting to perform the additional copies in this scenario
wouldn’t work anyway, because the third-party media is no longer available.

<p>To ensure that the names of the INF files are always different to
avoid support issues, do not use names like OEM&lt;n&gt;.inf (e.g. OEM1.INF), or
a name that is the same as the name of a system provided INF file.
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Some multifunction devices do not have a single base INF file. For example, for
a multifunction PCI card, all functions are enumerated as peers of each other. Therefore,
a co-installer created for such a device must be registered for each function, and each
function’s installation would have to reference the other INFs, because there is no
guarantee as to which function will be enumerated first.</li>
</ul>

<H3>USING THE CO-INSTALLER</H3>
<h5>To use the co-installer for driver installation and registration:</h5>
<p style="margin-left:0in;tab-stops:.5in">Copy the 32-bit Cocpyinf.dll redistributable binary to the directory
where you are assembling your driver package. You should use this following
version of cocpyinf.dll:
<blockquote>
<p><b>tools\coinstallers\x86</b><b>\cocpyinf.dll</b></blockquote>
<p>To use this co-installer, add the following sections to every INF
file for your drivers. If the multifunction device is a single parent that enumerates multiple
children, then only the parent’s INF needs to install or use the co-installer.

<p><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add a [<i>DDInstall</i>.CoInstallers] section for each device
specified in the INF. This section must include the following two lines:
<blockquote>
<p><style="margin-left:.5in">AddReg = CoCopyINF.AddReg<br>
CopyFiles= CoCopyINF.CopyFiles
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><style="margin-left:.5in">For example:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><style="margin-left:.5in">[InstallA.NT.CoInstallers]<br>
AddReg = CoCopyINF.AddReg<br>
CopyFiles= CoCopyINF.CopyFiles
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add the following sections:

<blockquote>
<p><style="margin-left:.5in">[CoCopyINF.AddReg]<br>
HKR,,CoInstallers32,0x10000,&quot;cocpyinf.DLL,CoCopyINF&quot;<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
<style="margin-left:.5in">[CoCopyINF.CopyFiles]<br>
cocpyinf.dll,,,0x10
</blockquote>

<p style="tab-stops:list .25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add a reference to the CopyFiles section in the [DestinationDirs]
section. For example:

<blockquote>
<p><style="margin-left:.5in">[DestinationDirs]<br>
CoCopyINF.CopyFiles = 11
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add references to all the other INF files in the package in the [<i>DDInstall</i>]
section. For&nbsp;example:

<blockquote>
<p><style="margin-left:.5in">[InstallA.NT]<br>
CopyInf = B.INF
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add sections to install the drivers.<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
For more information, see the sample INF files located at &lt;ddkroot&gt;\src\setup\cocpyinf\install.

<H3>TESTING</H3>
<p>To ensure that the INF files are not in the system, type:
<p>Del %windir%\INF\OEM*.?NF
<p>Note that this step is only safe to do for testing purposes, and will delete any
other third party INF files that are present on the system. The system may be left in an unstable state.
<p>Uninstall the devices in Device Manager.

<p>Install the devices by clicking on the &quot;Scan for
hardware changes&quot; item in the Device Manager Action Menu.

<p>Once all the relevant devices have been installed, you should
check that a re-install also works. Uninstall the devices in Device Manager
again (this time without removing the OEM*.?NF files) and click on &quot;Scan
for hardware changes&quot; again.
