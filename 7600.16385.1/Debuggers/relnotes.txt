What's New

This release of Debugging Tools for Windows contains many bug fixes and new
enhancements. The debuggers are stable and more reliable than previous 
releases and we recommend that you upgrade to this version.

Here's some of the key changes in this version of Debugging Tools for Windows:

1)	Several bug fixes in extensions to only use public symbols
2)	General BugCheck Analysis Updates including
		a) Bug Check 0x9F Update – Add logic to diagnose bugcheck 0x9F minidumps using new to Windows 7 data added to the 0x9F Mini Dumps by the Kernel and Networking Teams.
		Data includes:
			All Kernel ExWorkerThreads that process Power IRPs.
			IRPs Associated with any ExWorkerThread
			IRPs Associated with  PnP Completion Queue.  
			All Kernel Power IRPs
			Device Stacks for all IRPS
			NT_TRIAGE_POWER Structure
			NT_TRIAGE_PNP structure

		b.) BugCheck 0xFE Update - Add logic to diagnose bugcheck 0xFE minidumps using new to Windows 7 callback data added by the USB team.
3)	Fixed user-mode minidump generation problem.
4)	Fixed buffer overrun in schannel transport.
5)	Fixed several kernel debugger transport issues.
6)	Fixed problem with debugger reporting incorrect FPO information.
7)	Allowed stack dumps deeper than 65535 if specified explicitly.
8)	Changed ".outmask /a" and ".outmask /d" to be set only instead of or/xor.
9)	The old ADPlus.vbs is being replaced by ADPlus.exe which requires the .Net Framework 2.0. For those cases where the .Net Framework isn't available we are still shipping the older version renamed to adplus_old.vbs. For detailed documentation of the new ADPlus.exe as well as for its new companion ADPlusManager.exe please see adplus.doc located in the same folder as adplus.exe.


    Additional details on some of these features can be found in the debugger
    documentation (debugger.chm).  To open this documentation, use 
    Start --> Debugging Tools for Windows --> Debugging Help.

    CDB       - Command-line user-mode debugger (variant of NTSD)
    WinDbg    - GUI kernel debugger

I386KD is also provided in the package to support backwards compatibility. 
It has the same code-base as KD.

There are several debugger-related tools included with the package.  They
are identified as a subcategory under Tools in the custom menu during 
install. This subcategory is called "Helpful Tools" and it is installed by
default.

The Helpful Tools option is installed by default and includes these
debugger-related tools:

    DumpChk      - A tool used to validate a memory dump file.
    KDbgCtrl     - A tool that controls and configures the kernel debugging connection.
    KdSrv        - A KD connection server used for remote debugging.
    Logger       - A tool and an extension DLL that record the function calls and other actions of a program.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Debugger Extensions

Debugger Extensions are DLLs that WinDbg, CDB, NTSD, and KD can use to 
provide additional debugger commands.

The extensions that work for all versions of Windows reside in the "winext"
subdirectory, and include:

    uext.dll
    kext.dll
    ext.dll
    logexts.dll


The newest version-specific debugger extensions (which work on Windows XP,
Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 2008 Server Windows 7) reside
in the "winxp" subdirectory, and include:

    exts.dll
    kdexts.dll

The debugger extension DLLs for Windows 2000 is operating system 
version and debug/retail specific.  However, these extensions should 
properly support all service packs based on that build.  
Multiple versions of each DLL are included, to provide the necessary 
files for each variant. All DLLs are provided in both debug and retail 
versions.  The debug and retail versions of these DLLs for Windows 2000 
are installed into four subdirectories,under the target subdirectory:

    w2kchk
    w2kfre
    
The debugger has awareness of these subdirectories, and will not be able
to find them if these subdirectories are renamed or moved.

If a custom extension DLL is to be used, it should be placed in its own
directory.  The user can then set the debugger extension path variable so the
debugger can find the extension.  Debugger extensions can also be loaded in
the debugger using fully qualified path names.

All of the debuggers search for debugger extension DLLs in a series of 
directories.  For a list of these directories and the sequence in which they
are searched, open the documentation, choose the Index tab, type "extension",
and click on "default search order" in the listing under "extension".


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Software Development Samples


Header files, libraries and samples for debugger extensions are provided
in this package.  They are not installed by default.  The "SDK"
component of the package must be selected during the install to get the
samples installed.

Use the Build utility to compile and build these samples.  You must use
the version of the Build utility supplied by the latest version of the
Windows WDK or the Platform SDK.  These kits include several different
build environment windows; it is important that you use the "Windows
Server 2003 Build Environment" or "Windows Vista Build Environment"
windows -- even if you are building samples or extensions for use on a
different version of Windows.

Attempting to build the samples and headers in a "Windows 2000 Build
Environment" will cause compilation errors.  Building them in a "Windows
XP Build Environment" may succeed in some cases, but it is not
recommended.  The "Windows 2003 Server Build Environment" and "Windows
Vista Build Environment" windows are the ones that should be used in all
cases.

The header files and libs in this package should replace any existing
version of the header files or libs that are shipped with the Windows
WDK or the Platform SDK.  If you follow the instructions for using the
Build utility, which appear in the Windows WDK documentation, you can
set your include paths so that this is done automatically.

The samples will not compile if they are located in a directory path 
containing spaces.  If you have installed Debugging Tools for Windows into a
path with spaces, you can work around this limitation by moving or copying the
"sdk" subdirectory to a directory path without spaces.

Documentation

For documentation on how to use these debuggers and related tools, see the
help file debugger.chm that is included with the tools.  This documentation
has been improved and expanded since the last release.

When Debugging Tools for Windows is installed, a shortcut to this documentation
can be found under Start --> Programs --> Debugging Tools for Windows -->
Debugging Help.

You may also choose to review the most current documentation on MSDN: 
	http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc267445.aspx

Information on how to write debugger extensions is included in this same
documentation file.  If you plan to write debugger extensions, you should
perform a custom install of Debugging Tools for Windows and select all
available features.  This will ensure that you have all the necessary
extension headers, libraries, and samples.

The DbgHelp interface is documented in a separate documentation file
(dbghelp.chm).

A tutorial on kernel debugging, Kernel_Debugging_Tutorial.doc, is also included
in this installation.  This file is helpful if you are familiar with other
debugging tools and want to learn how to use WinDbg for kernel debugging.

You need to have Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater installed in order to use
the documentation properly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Redistributables

Please read the license agreement during setup for legal information regarding
redistributable files.  If this is a retail release, the license agreement 
mentions that redist.txt gives a list of the files that are redistributable.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

More Information

For more information on debugging, see the Debugging Tools for Windows
web page, <http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/DevTools/Debugging>.

We encourage people to get the new debugger off the web "often", as
we do many updates, while keeping compatibility with current, and Beta 
versions of Windows.

Version 6.9 was the last debugger release that supported NT 4.0.
