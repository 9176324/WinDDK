         <doc>
            <P>
            This warning indicates that the indicated file has not been checked, because the source file has been modified after the build.
            This typically happens if OACR is running in asynchronous (i.e. batch or daemon) mode, and the user has edited the file after
            building, but before OACR tried to check the file. The file will be scheduled to be checked when it is built the next time.

            <format>Error processing file : Cannot create precompiled header</format>

            <P>
            NOTE: This warning is being phased out. It has been replaced by scanner specific warnings in the range 20050-20059.
            </P>
            <P>
            This warning indicates that the indicated file has not been checked, because the precompiled header was missing, and could not be generated.
            This is for example caused by:
            <ul>
               <li>Build errors in precompiled headers. This should be indicated by a respective OACR warning.</li>
               <li>Build environments that use temporary source files for precompiled headers. If OACR is configured to
               run asynchronously in such an environment, then the source file is no longer available when OACR needs it.
               The fix is to change the build environment to not delete the source file (recomended), or configure OACR with
               the 'CheckPCHAtCompileTime=1' setting (last resort, not recommended due to increased build time overhead).</li>
               <li>Enabling OACR without doing an initial full build. In that case, OACR doesn't know how to generate the precompiled header.</li>
               <li>Tampering with the OACR build root directory, deleting build history information that allows OACR to regenerate precompiled headers.</li>
            </ul>
            </P>

            This warning is always generated at compile time, even if OACR is configured to check files asynchronously in batch or daemon mode.
            This also means that the warning is not generated by a check run from a backup copy of a project queue, e.g. through the 'oacr recheck' command.

               This warning indicates that the indicated source file has not been checked by PREfast, because the precompiled header was missing, and could not be generated.

               This warning indicates that there have been non-fatal errors during the FxCop check.
               See the FxCop log for information on the failure. Run 'oacr log &lt;project&gt; /fxcop'
               for the respective project (e.g. 'oacr log mso /fxcop') to see the FxCop log.
               Note, that the log is only available until the next full build is started,
               i.e. until the next 'oacr clean &lt;project&gt;' call.
