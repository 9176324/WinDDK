Routine Description:

    This routine is used to determine if TargetDevice belongs to the DSM.

    DsmContext   - Context value given to the multipath driver during registration.
    TargetDevice - DeviceObject for the child device.
    PortFdo      - The Port driver FDO on which TargetDevice resides.
    Descriptor   - Pointer the device descriptor corresponding to TargetDevice. Rehash of inquiry
                   data, plus serial number information (if applicable).
    DeviceIdList - VPD Page 0x83 information.
    DsmIdentifier - Pointer to be filled in by the DSM on success.

Return Value:

    STATUS_SUCCESS and a DsmIdentifier if the DSM supports this device.
    Otherwise a NULL Identifier and the appropriate NTSTATUS value (SUCCESS or other).

Routine Description:

    This routine is called to determine if the device ids represent the same underlying

    It is the DSM responsibility to keep the necessary information to identify the device(s).

Arguments:

Routine Description:

    This routine is used to get information about the controller that the device
    corresponding to DsmId in on.
    The Dsm shall allocate the necessary memory for the buffer (mpio has the responsibility
    to free it) and fill in the information.
    If the DSM controls hardware that uses no controllers, set State to NO_CNTRL.
    This information is used mainly by whatever WMI admin. utilities want if.

    This routine will be called initially after SetDeviceInfo, but also to retrieve
    the controller's state when an WMI request is received, after a fail-over/fail-back, etc.

Arguments:

    DsmContext - Context value given to the multipath driver during registration.
    DsmId - Identifer returned from DMS_INQUIRE_DRIVER.
    Flags - Bitfield of modifiers. If ALLOCATE is not set, ControllerInfo will have
            a valid buffer for the DSM to operate on.
    ControllerInfo - Pointer  for  the DSM to place the allocated controller info
                     pertaining to DsmId

    The buffer returned should be a null-terminated ascii string. MPIO is responsible for
    freeing this buffer and the DSM should not assume it's valid anytime after returning.

Routine Description:

    This routine associates a returned DsmId to the controlling MPDisk PDO
    the targetObject for DSM-initiated requests, and to a Path (given by PathId).
    The Path ID is a unique per-path value and will be the same value for ALL devices that
    are on the same physical path.

Arguments:

    DsmContext - Context value given to the multipath driver during registration.
    TargetObject - The D.O. to which DSM-initiated requests should be sent.
                   This is the Filter D.O. over the port PDO.
    DsmId - Value returned from DMSInquireDriver.
    PathId - Id that represents the path. The value passed in may be used as is, or the DSM
             optionally can update it if it requires additional state info to be kept.


Return Value:

    DSM should return SUCCESS. Other errors may be returned in event of failed
    allocations, etc. These other errors are fatal.

Routine Description:

    This routine is used to determine whether the path to DsmId is active
    (ie. able to handle requests without a failover).
    NOTE: This is used by the main module to determine load balance groups. If multiple
    paths are active to the same device then it is considered that requests can be
    submitted freely to ALL active paths, though the DSM is the determinator for path
    selection.

    In addition, after a failover, the path validity will be queried. If the path error
    was transitory and the DSM feels that the path is good, then this request will be
    re-issued to determine it's ACTIVE/PASSIVE state.

Arguments:

    DsmContext - Context value given to the multipath driver during registration.
    PathId - Value set in SetDeviceInfo
    DsmId - Device Identifier returned from DsmInquire.

Return Value:

    TRUE - if path is active. Otherwise, FALSE.

    The DSM should examine these, carry out any vendor-unique activities and update Retry and Status
