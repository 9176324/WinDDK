  This registry key can be used to configure NLB to allow inter-host 
  communication in a unicast cluster under the following conditions:

  (i)  EVERY host in the cluster is properly configured with a Dedicated
       IP address, where "properly configured" implies:

       (a) The Dedicated IP address configured in NLB is valid
       (b) The Dedicated IP address configured in NLB has been added to
           to the TCP/IP properties IP address list OF THE NLB ADAPTER
       (c) The Dedicated IP address is the FIRST IP address listed in
           the TCP/IP properties IP address list OF THE NLB ADAPTER

       If any of these conditions is not met, do not expect inter-host 
       communication to work between all hosts, nor under all circumstances.

  (ii) The host is operating in unicast mode

  If the host is operating in eith multicast mode (multicast or IGMP multicast, 
  this feature is not needed, as hosts can already communication between one 
  another without additional support.

  This registry key will not exist by default, but can be created and
  set on a per-adapter basis under the following registry hive:
        
    HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\WLBS\Parameters\Interface\{GUID}\

  where {GUID} is the GUID of the particular NLB instance (use the "ClusterIP
  Address" key in this hive to identify clusters).  This key is boolean in 
  nature and is interpreted as follows:

    = 0 -> The feature is not active
    > 0 -> The feature is active

  ** This feature is intended solely for the purpose of inter-host communication 
  within a clustered firewall application (for example, Microsoft ISA Server).  
  Though its use outside of these types of applications is not precluded, ITS 
  USE OUTSIDE OF THESE APPLICATIONS IS EXPLICITLY NOT SUPPORTED BY MICROSOFT.

  These registry keys instruct NLB on which notification mechanism to use.
  When deciding what notifications to use for a given type of notification X, 
  NLB checks the following, in this order:

  (i)  NLB first looks for the Enable[X]Notification registry key under 
        
       HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\WLBS\Parameters\Global\
        
       This key has three possible values that instruct NLB on which 
       notifications to listen for. They are:

         0 = Do not use any notifications.
         1 = Use the TCP/IP stack's internal notifications.
         2 = Use the NLB public callback notifications.

  (ii) If the Enable[X]Notification registry key is not present, NLB
       defaults to using the internal TCP/IP notifications.
  
  Note: The EnableSYNAttackNotification and EnableTimerStarvationNotification
  keys are not available in Windows Server 2003. Also, post-Windows Server 
  2003, a value of 0 is not permitted for the EnableTCPNotification key.

/* This is the public callback object on which NLB will listen for all
   public notifications.  Currently, the types of notifications accepted by 
   NLB are session state notifications for TCP (protocol=6), SYN attack
   notifications, and timer starvation notifications (*).
  
   To notify NLB of the beginning/end of a SYN attack or timer starvation,
   open the callback object and call ExNotifyCallback with the following
   parameters:

   CallbackObject - The handle to the NLB public callback object.
   Argument1 - A callback code of type NLB_PUBLIC_CALLBACK_CODE, set to the
               NLBSYNAttackBegins[Ends] or NLBTimerStarvationBegins[Ends] 
               value.
   Argument2 - NULL (this parameter is unused)
   
   NLB requires that each begin notification is accompanied by a
   corresponding end notification. Furthermore, NLB makes no guarantees as 
   to the order in which multiple begin/end notifications are processed; it 
   is up to the caller to provide any necessary serialization.

   To notify NLB when connections change state, open the callback object,
   and call ExNotifyCallback with the following parameters (**):
   
   CallbackObject - The handle to the NLB public callback object.
   Argument1 - A callback code of type NLB_PUBLIC_CALLBACK_CODE, set to the 
               NLBSessionStateChange value.
   Argument2 - A pointer to an NLBConnectionInfo block, defined below.

   For TCP connections, NLB needs to be notified of the following state
   changes:

   CLOSED -> SYN_RCVD: A new incoming connection is being established.  This
   notification requires the IP interface index on which the SYN was
   received.  NLB will create state on the appropriate interface to track
   this TCP connection.
   
   CLOSED -> SYN_SENT: A new outgoing connection is being established.  At
   this time, it is unknown on which interface the connection will
   ultimately be established, so the IP interface index is NOT required for
   this notification.  NLB will create temporary state to track this
   connection should it return on an NLB interface.

   SYN_SENT -> ESTAB: An outgoing connection has been established.  This
   nofication requires the IP interface index on which the connection was
   ultimately established.  If the interface was NLB, state will be created
   to track the new connection; if the interface was not NLB, the temporary
   state created by the SYN_SENT notification is cleaned up.

   SYN_RCVD -> ESTAB: An incoming connection has been established.  This
   notification is not currently required by NLB.

   SYN_SENT -> CLOSED: An outgoing connection has been prematurely
   terminated (the connection never reached the ESTABlished state).  This
   notification does not require the IP interface index.  NLB will destroy
   any state created to track this connection.

   SYN_RCVD -> CLOSED: An outgoing connection has been prematurely
   terminated (the connection never reached the ESTABlished state).  This
   notification does not require the IP interface index.  NLB will destroy
   any state created to track this connection.
   
   ESTAB -> CLOSED: A connection has been *completely* terminated (i.e., the
   connection has gone through TIME_WAIT, if necessary, already).  This
   notification does not require the IP interface index.  NLB will destroy
   any state created to track this connection.

   (*) SYN attack and timer starvation notifications are not available in
   Windows Server 2003.

   (**) In Windows Server 2003, the pointer to the NLBConnectionInfo block
   is passed in Argument1 and Argument2 is set to NULL (unused).

   is not sufficient to find all necessary packet information, the
   packet pointer can be used to traverse the packet buffers manually 
   to try and find the information needed.  However, note that the

   table should be a pointer to a hook table of the type required by the
