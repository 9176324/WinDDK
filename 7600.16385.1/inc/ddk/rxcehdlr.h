Module Name:

    rxcehdlr.h

Abstract:

    This is the include file that defines all constants and types for
    accessing the redirector file system connection engine.

Revision History:
Notes:

    The Connection engine is designed to map and emulate the TDI specs. as closely
    as possible. This implies that on NT we will have a very efficient mechanism
    which fully exploits the underlying TDI implementation.

    All the necessary types can be redefined in terms of the types defined in
    \nt\private\inc\tdi.h in the case of NT. For Win95 we will provide the
    appropriate definitions.
