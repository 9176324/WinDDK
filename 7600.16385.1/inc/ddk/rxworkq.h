    This module defines the data structures required to implement the dispatching
    mechanism in RDBSS for use by RDBSS as well as all the mini redirectors.

// The RDBSS needs to keep track of the work items on a per device object basis.
// This enables the race conditions associated with loading/unloading as well as
// a mechanism for preventing a single mini redirector from unfairly hogging all
// the resources.

//
// There are certain scenarios in which dispatching of work items is inevitable.
// In such instance the WORK_QUEUE_ITEM is allocated as part of another data
// structure to avoid frequent allocation/freeing. In other scenarios where
// dispatching is rare it pays to avoid the allocation of the memory till it
// is rquired. The RDBSS work queue implementations provide for both these
// scenarios in the form of dispatching and posting work queue requests. In
// the case of dispatching no memory for the WORK_QUEUE_ITEM need be allocated
// by the caller while for posting the memory for WORK_QUEUE_ITEM needs to be
// allocated by the caller.

// The rundown of work queues is not complete when the threads have been spun down.
// The termination of the threads needs to be ensured before the data structures
// can be torn down. The work queue implementation follows a protocol in which
// each of the threads being spundown stashes a reference to the thread object
// in the rundown context. The rundown issuing thread ( which does not belong to
// the work queue ) waits for the completion of all the threads spundown before
// tearing down the data structures.

//
// The work queue implementation is built around a KQUEUE implementation. The
// additional support involves the regulation of number of threads that are
// actively waiting for the work items. Each work queue data structure is
// allocated in nonpaged pool and has its own synchronization mechanism ( spinlock).
//
// In addition to the bookkeeing information, i.e., state, type etc. it also includes
// statistics that are gathered over the lifetime of the queue. This will
// provide valuable information in tuning a work queue instance. The number of items
// that have been processed , the number of items that have to be processed and
// the cumulative queue length is recorded. The cumulative queue length is the
// intersiting metric, it is the sum of the number of items awaiting to be processed
// each time an additional work item was queued. The cumulative queue length
// divided by the sum of the total number of items processed and the anumber of
// items to be processed gives an indication of the average length of the
// queue. A value much greater than one signifies that the  minimum number of
// worker threads associated with the work queue can be increased. A value much
// less than one signifies that the maximum number of work threads associated
// with the queue can be decreased.

// The dispatching mechanism in RDBSS provides for multiple levels of work queues
// on a per processor basis. There are three levels of work queues currently
// supported, Critical,Delayed and HyperCritical. The distinction between Critical
// and delayed is one of priority where as HyperCritical iss different from the
// other two in that the routines should not block, i.e., wait for any resource.
// This requirement cannot be enforced hence the effectiveness of the dispatching
// mechanism relies on the implicit cooperation of the clients.

// The RDBSS dispatching mechanism on any machine is an array of the dispatchers
// associated with each processor. When a work queue item is queued a best effort
// is made to contain the work emanating from a processor onto the same processor.
// This ensures that processor affinities setup by the NT dispatcher are not
// destroyed by the RDBSS dispatching mechanism as this could lead to excessive
// sloshing. When the work needs to be moved there are two metrics that will be
// useful in making the decision, teh amount of delay that will be experienced
// by the work item in the current queue and the effort involved in moving the
// work item to the other queue. It is very easy to quantify the former but very
// difficult to quantify the later.
