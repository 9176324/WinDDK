Routine Description:

    This routine is a callback into the driver to retrieve information about
    the guids being registered.
	
    Implementations of this routine may be in paged memory

Arguments:

    DeviceObject is the device whose registration information is needed

    *RegFlags returns with a set of flags that describe all of the guids being
        registered for this device. If the device wants enable and disable
        collection callbacks before receiving queries for the registered
        guids then it should return the WMIREG_FLAG_EXPENSIVE flag. Also the
        returned flags may specify WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO in which case
        the instance name is determined from the PDO associated with the
        device object. Note that the PDO must have an associated devnode. If
        WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO is not set then Name must return a unique
        name for the device. These flags are ORed into the flags specified
        by the GUIDREGINFO for each guid.		

    InstanceName returns with the instance name for the guids if
        WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO is not set in the returned *RegFlags. The
        caller will call ExFreePool with the buffer returned.

    *RegistryPath returns with the registry path of the driver. This is
        required
		
    MofResourceName returns with the name of the MOF resource attached to
        the binary file. If the driver does not have a mof resource attached
        then this can be returned unmodified. If a value is returned then
        it is NOT freed.
		
    *Pdo returns with the device object for the PDO associated with this
        device if the WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO flag is retured in
        *RegFlags.

Return Value:

    status

Routine Description:

    This routine is a callback into the driver to query for the contents of
    one or more instances of a data block. When the driver has finished
    filling the
    data block it must call WmiCompleteRequest to complete the irp. The
    driver can return STATUS_PENDING if the irp cannot be completed
    immediately.

    Implementations of this routine may be in paged memory

Arguments:

    DeviceObject is the device whose data block is being queried

    Irp is the Irp that makes this request

    GuidIndex is the index into the list of guids provided when the
        device registered

    InstanceIndex is the index that denotes which instance of the data block
        is being queried.

    InstanceCount is the number of instances expected to be returned for
        the data block.

    InstanceLengthArray is a pointer to an array of ULONG that returns the
        lengths of each instance of the data block. If this is NULL then
        there was not enough space in the output buffer to fufill the request
        so the irp should be completed with the buffer needed.

    BufferAvail on entry has the maximum size available to write the data
        blocks.

    Buffer on return is filled with the returned data blocks. Note that each
        instance of the data block must be aligned on a 8 byte boundry. If
        this is NULL then there was not enough space in the output buffer
	to fufill the request so the irp should be completed with the buffer
        needed.

Routine Description:

    generation or data block collection. A device should only expect a
    single enable when the first event or data consumer enables events or
    data collection and a single disable when the last event or data
    consumer disables events or data collection. Data blocks will only
    receive collection enable/disable if they were registered as requiring
    it.

Arguments:

    DeviceObject is the device whose data block is being queried

    GuidIndex is the index into the list of guids provided when the
        device registered

    Function specifies which functionality is being enabled or disabled

    Enable is TRUE then the function is being enabled else disabled

Routine Description:


    This routine will do the work of completing a WMI irp. Depending upon the
    the WMI request this routine will fixup the returned WNODE appropriately.

    This may be called at DPC level
Arguments:

    DeviceObject - Supplies a pointer to the device object for this request.

    Irp - Supplies the Irp making the request.

    Status has the return status code for the IRP

    BufferUsed has the number of bytes needed by the device to return the
       data requested in any query. In the case that the buffer passed to
       the device is too small this has the number of bytes needed for the
       return data. If the buffer passed is large enough then this has the
       number of bytes actually used by the device.

    PriorityBoost is the value used for the IoCompleteRequest call.
