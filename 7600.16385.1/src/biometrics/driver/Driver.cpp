Module Name:

    Driver.cpp

Abstract:

    This module contains the implementation of the Biometric
    core driver callback object.

Environment:

   Windows User-Mode Driver Framework (WUDF)

  Routine Description:

    The FX invokes this method when it wants to install our driver on a device
    stack.  This method creates a device callback object, then calls the Fx
    to create an Fx device object and associate the new callback object with
    it.

  Arguments:

    FxWdfDriver - the Fx driver object.

    FxDeviceInit - the initialization information for the device.

  Return Value:

    status

    // Call the device's construct method.  This 
    // allows the device to create any queues or other structures that it
    // needs now that the corresponding fx device object has been created.
