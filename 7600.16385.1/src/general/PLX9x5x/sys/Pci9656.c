Module Name:

    Pci9656.c

Abstract:

    This is a generic WDF sample driver for PLx PCI9656RDK-Lite reference
    adapter. It illustrates how to use the WDF DmaObject to perform
    Scatter/Gather DMA operations.

Environment:

    Kernel mode

Routine Description:

    Performs whatever initialization is needed to setup the device, setting up
    a DMA channel or mapping any I/O port resources.  This will only be called
    as a device starts or restarts, not every time the device moves into the D0
    state.  Consequently, most hardware initialization belongs elsewhere.

Arguments:

    Device - A handle to the WDFDEVICE

    Resources - The raw PnP resources associated with the device.  Most of the
        time, these aren't useful for a PCI device.

    ResourcesTranslated - The translated PnP resources associated with the
        device.  This is what is important to a PCI device.

Routine Description:

    This routine prepares the device for use.  It is called whenever the device
    enters the D0 state, which happens when the device is started, when it is
    restarted, and when it has been powered off.

    Note that interrupts will not be enabled at the time that this is called.
    They will be enabled after this callback completes.

    This function is not marked pageable because this function is in the
    device power up path. When a function is marked pagable and the code
    section is paged out, it will generate a page fault which could impact
    the fast resume behavior because the client driver will have to wait
    until the system drivers can service this page fault.

Arguments:

    Device  - The handle to the WDF device object

    PreviousState - The state the device was in before this callback was invoked.

Return Value:

    is stopped, when it is removed, and when it is powered off.

    The device is still in D0 when this callback is invoked, which means that
