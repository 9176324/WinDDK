# This is a minimal sample code meant to demonstrate the usage of the synchronization macros.
# Plot.dll will be generated on build Pass2 that links with drawlib.lib.
# No need of synchronization PRODUCES/CONSUMES macros here since drawlib.lib is generated during 
# the build Pass1 and the plot.dll is generated on build Pass2.
