Module Name:

    device.c - Device handling events for example driver.

Abstract:

    This is a C version of a very simple sample driver that illustrates
    how to use the driver framework and demonstrates best practices.

Routine Description:

    Worker routine called to create a device and its software resources.

Arguments:

    DeviceInit - Pointer to an opaque init structure. Memory for this
                    structure will be freed by the framework when the WdfDeviceCreate
                    succeeds. So don't access the structure after that point.

Return Value:

    NTSTATUS

Routine Description:

    This event is called by the Framework when the device is started
    or restarted after a suspend operation.

    This function is not marked pageable because this function is in the
    device power up path. When a function is marked pagable and the code
    section is paged out, it will generate a page fault which could impact
    the fast resume behavior because the client driver will have to wait
    until the system drivers can service this page fault.

Arguments:

    Device - Handle to a framework device object.

Return Value:

    NTSTATUS - Failures will result in the device stack being torn down.
