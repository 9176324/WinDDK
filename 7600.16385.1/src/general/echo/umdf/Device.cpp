  Routine Description:

    This method initializes the device callback object and creates the
    partner device object.

    The method should perform any device-specific configuration that:
        *  could fail (these can't be done in the constructor)
        *  must be done before the partner object is created -or-
        *  can be done after the partner object is created and which aren't
           influenced by any device-level parameters the parent (the driver
           in this case) might set.

  Arguments:

    FxDeviceInit - the settings for this device.

  Return Value:

    status.
