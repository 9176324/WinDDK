    )
/*++
Routine Description:

    EvtDeviceD0Entry event is called to program the device to goto
    D0, which is the working state. The framework calls the driver's
    EvtDeviceD0Entry callback when the Power manager sends an
    IRP_MN_SET_POWER-DevicePower request to the driver stack. The Power manager
    sends this request when the power policy manager of this device stack
    (probaby the FDO) requests a change in D-state by calling PoRequestPowerIrp.

    This function is not marked pageable because this function is in the
    device power up path. When a function is marked pagable and the code
    section is paged out, it will generate a page fault which could impact
    the fast resume behavior because the client driver will have to wait
    until the system drivers can service this page fault.

Arguments:

    Device - handle to a framework device object.

    RecentPowerState - WDF_POWER_DEVICE_STATE-typed enumerator that identifies the
                device power state that the device was in before this transition
                to D0.

Return Value:

    NTSTATUS    - A failure here will indicate a fatal error in the driver.
                  The Framework will attempt to tear down the stack.

/*++
Routine Description:

    EvtDeviceD0Entry event is called to program the device to goto
    D1, D2 or D3, which are the low-power states. The framework calls the
    driver's EvtDeviceD0Exit callback when the Power manager sends an
    IRP_MN_SET_POWER-DevicePower request to the driver stack. The Power manager
    sends this request when the power policy manager of this device stack
    (probaby the FDO) requests a change in D-state by calling PoRequestPowerIrp.

Arguments:

    Device - handle to a framework device object.

    DeviceState - WDF_POWER_DEVICE_STATE-typed enumerator that identifies the
                device power state that the power policy owner (probably the
                FDO) has decided is appropriate.

Return Value:

    NTSTATUS    - A failure here will indicate a fatal error in the driver.
                  The Framework will attempt to tear down the stack.

Routine Description:

    interrupt signals to the wake logic, it should be done here.  The device

    This function is pageable and it will run at PASSIVE_LEVEL.
