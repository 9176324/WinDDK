Module Name:

    Toaster.c

Abstract:

    This is a featured version of the toaster function driver. This version
    shows how to register for PNP and Power events, handle create & close
    file requests, handle WMI set and query events, fire WMI notification
    events. This driver is functionally equivalent to the feature2 version
    of toaster WDM driver present in the DDK
    (src\general\toaster\func\featured2).


Environment:

    Kernel mode

Routine Description:
    DriverEntry initializes the driver and is the first routine called by the
    system after the driver is loaded. DriverEntry specifies the other entry
    points in the function driver, such as ToasterAddDevice and ToasterUnload.

Parameters Description:

    DriverObject - represents the instance of the function driver that is loaded
    into memory. DriverEntry must initialize members of DriverObject before it
    returns to the caller. DriverObject is allocated by the system before the
    driver is loaded, and it is released by the system after the system unloads
    the function driver from memory.

    RegistryPath - represents the driver specific path in the Registry.
    The function driver can use the path to store driver related data between
    reboots. The path does not store hardware instance specific data.

Return Value:

    STATUS_SUCCESS if successful,
    STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL otherwise.

    )
/*++

Routine Description:

    EvtDevicePrepareHardware event callback performs operations that are
    necessary to make the driver's device operational. The framework calls the
    driver's EvtDevicePrepareHardware callback when the PnP manager sends an
    IRP_MN_START_DEVICE request to the driver stack.

    Specifically, most drivers will use this callback to map resources.  USB
    drivers may use it to get device descriptors, config descriptors and to
    select configs.

    Some drivers may choose to download firmware to a device in this callback,
    but that is usually only a good choice if the device firmware won't be
    destroyed by a D0 to D3 transition.  If firmware will be gone after D3,
    then firmware downloads should be done in EvtDeviceD0Entry, not here.

Arguments:

    Device - Handle to a framework device object.

    ResourcesRaw - Handle to a collection of framework resource objects.
                This collection identifies the raw (bus-relative) hardware
                resources that have been assigned to the device.

    ResourcesTranslated - Handle to a collection of framework resource objects.
                This collection identifies the translated (system-physical)
                hardware resources that have been assigned to the device.
                The resources appear from the CPU's point of view.

/*++

Routine Description:

    The framework calls a driver's EvtDeviceFileCreate callback
    when the framework receives an IRP_MJ_CREATE request.
    The system sends this request when a user application opens the
    device to perform an I/O operation, such as reading or writing to a device.
    This callback is called in the context of the thread
    that created the IRP_MJ_CREATE request.

Arguments:

    Device - Handle to a framework device object.
    FileObject - Pointer to fileobject that represents the open handle.
    CreateParams - Parameters for create

Return Value:

   NT status code

Routine Description:

   EvtFileClose is called when all the handles represented by the FileObject

   may get called in an arbitrary thread context instead of the thread that
   called CloseHandle. If you want to delete any per FileObject context that
   must be done in the context of the user thread that made the Create call,
   you should do that in the EvtDeviceCleanp callback.
