Module Name:

    Device.cpp

Abstract:

    This module contains the implementation of the UMDF Skeleton sample driver's
    device callback object.

    The skeleton sample device does very little.  It does not implement either
    of the PNP interfaces so once the device is setup, it won't ever get any
    callbacks until the device is removed.

Environment:

   Windows User-Mode Driver Framework (WUDF)

    This method creates and initializs an instance of the skeleton driver's 
    device callback object.

  Arguments:

    FxDeviceInit - the settings for the device.

    Device - a location to store the referenced pointer to the device object.

  Return Value:

    Status

  Routine Description:

    This method initializes the device callback object and creates the
    partner device object.

    The method should perform any device-specific configuration that:
        *  could fail (these can't be done in the constructor)
        *  must be done before the partner object is created -or-
        *  can be done after the partner object is created and which aren't 
           influenced by any device-level parameters the parent (the driver
           in this case) might set.

  Arguments:

    FxDeviceInit - the settings for this device.

  Return Value:

    status.

  Routine Description:

  Routine Description:

    This method is called to get a pointer to one of the object's callback
    interfaces.  

    Since the skeleton driver doesn't support any of the device events, this
    method simply calls the base class's BaseQueryInterface.

    If the skeleton is extended to include device event interfaces then this 
    method must be changed to check the IID and return pointers to them as
    appropriate.

  Arguments:

    InterfaceId - the interface being requested

    Object - a location to store the interface pointer if successful

  Return Value:

    S_OK or E_NOINTERFACE
