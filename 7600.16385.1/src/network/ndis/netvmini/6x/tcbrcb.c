Module Name:

        TcbRcb.C

Abstract:

    This module contains miniport functions for handling Send & Receive
    packets and other helper routines called by these miniport functions.

    In order to excercise the send and receive code path of this driver,
    you should install more than one instance of the miniport. If there
    is only one instance installed, the driver throws the send packet on
    the floor and completes the send successfully. If there are more
    instances present, it indicates the incoming send packet to the other
    instances. For example, if there 3 instances: A, B, & C installed.
    Packets coming in for A instance would be indicated to B & C; packets
    coming into B would be indicated to C, & A; and packets coming to C
    would be indicated to A & B.

Routine Description:

    This routine gets an unused RCB from the pool.

    Runs at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL

Arguments:

    Adapter                     The receiving adapter
    Nbl1QInfo                   8021Q Tag information for the FRAME being received
    Frame                       The frame that will be attached to the RCB

Return Value:

    NULL if an RCB could not be allocated.
    Else, a pointer to an initialized RCB.

Routine Description:

    This routine frees an RCB back to the unused pool, recovers relevant memory used in the RCB.

Arguments:

    Adapter     - The receiving adapter (the one that owns the RCB).
    Rcb         - The RCB to be freed.

Return Value:

    None.
