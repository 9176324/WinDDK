Print Features Filter Sample Driver
===================================

Sample History:
===============

Windows 7:
The sample has been changed such that the DllGetClassObject() function for each filter
returns an instance of IClassFactory instead of an instance of IPrintPipelineFilter. This
is in agreement with the updated MSDN documentation surrounding XpsDrv filters.

Note: As reflected in the MSDN documentation, DllGetClassObject() functions that return
        IPrintPipelineFilter will still be compatible with the Print Pipeline in order to
        maintain compatibility with existing XpsDrv filters.
        
Also, the sample now uses the PrintSchema keyword PageSourceColorProfile to store the
color matching profile in the PrintTicket.
