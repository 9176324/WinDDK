Abstract:

   Base Xps filter definition. The CXDXpsFilter provides common filter
   functionality for Xps filters. It provides default handlers for part
   handlers that set print tickets appropriately through the PrintTicket
   manager class. This allows derived classes to implement only the part
   handlers that they require (for example, the watermark filter is only
   interested in the fixed page, and leaves all other parts to be handled
   by this class). The class implements IPrintPipelineFilter::StartOperation
   which is responsible for retrieving parts from the Xps provider and
   dispatching them to the relevant part handler. It is also responsible for
   intialising the Xps provider and consumer.
