Abstract:

   Base stream filter definition. This provides stream interface specific
   functionality general to all filters that use the stream interface to process
   fixed pages. The class is responsible copying data from reader to writer in the
   absence of the PK archive handling module, for a default fixed page processing
   function (filters should implement their own to manipulate fixed page markup)
   and for initialising the stream reader and writer.
