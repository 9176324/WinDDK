Description:

This sample demonstrates how to use the application-to-driver dependency 
feature of the Driver Install Frameworks (DIFx) API. The DriverPackageInstall
and the DriverPackageUninstall APIs allow the calling application to register
and remove dependencies on a driver package. In order to register or remove
a dependency on a driver package, the calling application needs to populate
the fields of an INSTALLERINFO structure with information about itself. It 
then needs to pass in this structure as a parameter to the DIFx APIs, as 
shown in this sample.
