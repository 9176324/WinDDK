     *   Physical pointer used by the scripts to maintain start queue position.
     *   Initialization requirements:  must be set to point to the head of the
     *   start queue    during driver initialization and after resets.
     *   - lockedQPhysPtr - 
     *   This field is used by the scripts to store the current start queue 
     *   position when doing auto request sense.  The scripts automatically
     *   restores the current position when all CA conditions are cleared.
     *   Initialization requirements:  none.
     *   - doneQPhysPtr -
     *   Physical pointer used by the scripts to maintain done queue position.
     *   Initialization requirements:  must be set to point to the head of the
     *   done queue during driver initialization and after resets.
     *   - caPutQPhysPtr -
     *   Physical pointer used by the scripts to maintain ca queue position
     *   for inserting commands that returned with check conditions.
     *   Initialization requirements:  must be set to point to the head of the
     *   ca queue during driver initialization and after resets.
     *   - caStartQPhysPtr -
     *   Physical pointer used by the scripts to maintain ca queue position
     *   for starting request sense commands to clear check conditions.
     *   Initialization requirements:  must be set to point to the head of the
     *   ca queue during driver initialization and after resets.
     *   - ITQnexusTablePhysPtr -
     *   Physical pointer used by scripts to obtain base address of nexus
     *   pointer lookup table for tagged commmands.
     *   Initialization requirements:  must be set during driver initialization.
     *   - ITLnexusTablePhysPtr -
     *   Physical pionter used by scripts to obtain base address of nexus
     *   pointer lookup table for non-tagged commands.
     *   Initialization requirements:  must be set during driver initialization.
     *   - msgInBuf - 
     *   This field is used as a scratch area by the scripts to store 
     *   message bytes received from the target device.  If the driver
     *   needs to examine message bytes, the data is stored here, as well.
