<title>This is a sample Intel USB camera minidriver</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This is a sample Intel USB camera minidriver. A USB camera minidriver is a 
kernel mode driver that serves to abstract the rest of the WDM video capture 
subsystem from the specifics of an individual USB camera hardware. This sample 
driver works in conjunction with USBCAMD (source included in DDK). It was 
written according to WDM video capture spec as well as USBCAMD sepc.<br>
<br>
This minidriver supports both of Intels's Create &amp; Share USB cameras (Models 
YC72, YC76).<br>
<br>
The code is provided mainly as a reference for people writing minidrivers to 
support other usb cameras . <br>
<br>
The INF file is provided mainly to illustrate the registry modifications 
required to make the minidriver visible to other WDM/KS components.<br>
<br>
This code has been updated to use the new interfaces in USBCAMD version 2. The 
define USBCAMD2 flag in the source files reflects that. This new version of the 
sample driver exposes an additional still pin. Hence, if you are using Intel 
camera model YC76, you will be able to take a snapshot eveytime you press the 
snapshot on the camera. To do that, insert the Intel camera filter in graphedt. 
You will see two pins: capture, still. Right click on the mouse on each pin and 
render, then press the play button. Once the video starts streaming on the video 
renderer, press the snapshot button, and you will see a still coming up on the 
video renderer connected to the still button.<br>
