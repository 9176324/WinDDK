=head1 NAME

Config - access Perl configuration information

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Config;
    if ($Config{'cc'} =~ /gcc/) {
	print "built by gcc\n";
    } 

    use Config qw(myconfig config_sh config_vars);

    print myconfig();

    print config_sh();

    config_vars(qw(osname archname));


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Config module contains all the information that was available to
the C<Configure> program at Perl build time (over 900 values).

Shell variables from the F<config.sh> file (written by Configure) are
stored in the readonly-variable C<%Config>, indexed by their names.

Values stored in config.sh as 'undef' are returned as undefined
values.  The perl C<exists> function can be used to check if a
named variable exists.

=over 4

=item myconfig()

Returns a textual summary of the major perl configuration values.
See also C<-V> in L<perlrun/Switches>.

=item config_sh()

Returns the entire perl configuration information in the form of the
original config.sh shell variable assignment script.

=item config_vars(@names)

Prints to STDOUT the values of the named configuration variable. Each is
printed on a separate line in the form:

  name='value';

Names which are unknown are output as C<name='UNKNOWN';>.
See also C<-V:name> in L<perlrun/Switches>.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

Here's a more sophisticated example of using %Config:

    use Config;
    use strict;

    my %sig_num;
    my @sig_name;
    unless($Config{sig_name} && $Config{sig_num}) {
	die "No sigs?";
    } else {
	my @names = split ' ', $Config{sig_name};
	@sig_num{@names} = split ' ', $Config{sig_num};
	foreach (@names) {
	    $sig_name[$sig_num{$_}] ||= $_;
	}   
    }

    print "signal #17 = $sig_name[17]\n";
    if ($sig_num{ALRM}) { 
	print "SIGALRM is $sig_num{ALRM}\n";
    }   

=head1 WARNING

Because this information is not stored within the perl executable
itself it is possible (but unlikely) that the information does not
relate to the actual perl binary which is being used to access it.

The Config module is installed into the architecture and version
specific library directory ($Config{installarchlib}) and it checks the
perl version number when loaded.

The values stored in config.sh may be either single-quoted or
double-quoted. Double-quoted strings are handy for those cases where you
need to include escape sequences in the strings. To avoid runtime variable
interpolation, any C<$> and C<@> characters are replaced by C<\$> and
C<\@>, respectively. This isn't foolproof, of course, so don't embed C<\$>
or C<\@> in double-quoted strings unless you're willing to deal with the
consequences. (The slashes will end up escaped and the C<$> or C<@> will
trigger variable interpolation)

=head1 GLOSSARY

Most C<Config> variables are determined by the C<Configure> script
on platforms supported by it (which is most UNIX platforms).  Some
platforms have custom-made C<Config> variables, and may thus not have
some of the variables described below, or may have extraneous variables
specific to that particular port.  See the port specific documentation
in such cases.

=head2 _

=over

=item C<_a>

From F<Unix.U>:

This variable defines the extension used for ordinary libraries.
For unix, it is F<.a>.  The F<.> is included.  Other possible
values include F<.lib>.

=item C<_exe>

From F<Unix.U>:

This variable defines the extension used for executable files.
For unix it is empty.  Other possible values include F<.exe>.

=item C<_o>

From F<Unix.U>:

This variable defines the extension used for object files.
For unix, it is F<.o>.  The F<.> is included.  Other possible
values include F<.obj>.

=back

=head2 a

=over

=item C<afs>

From F<afs.U>:

This variable is set to C<true> if C<AFS> (Andrew File System) is used
on the system, C<false> otherwise.  It is possible to override this
with a hint value or command line option, but you'd better know
what you are doing.

=item C<alignbytes>

From F<alignbytes.U>:

This variable holds the number of bytes required to align a
double-- or a long double when applicable. Usual values are
2, 4 and 8.  The default is eight, for safety.

=item C<ansi2knr>

From F<ansi2knr.U>:

This variable is set if the user needs to run ansi2knr.  
Currently, this is not supported, so we just abort.

=item C<aphostname>

From F<d_gethname.U>:

This variable contains the command which can be used to compute the
host name. The command is fully qualified by its absolute path, to make
it safe when used by a process with super-user privileges.

=item C<api_revision>

From F<patchlevel.U>:

The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
such as F<5.6.1>, api_revision is the C<5>.
Prior to 5.5.640, the format was a floating point number,
like 5.00563.

	F<perl.c>:incpush() and F<lib/lib.pm> will automatically search in

	$F<sitelib/.>. for older directories back to the limit specified
by these api_ variables.  This is only useful if you have a
perl library directory tree structured like the default one.
See C<INSTALL> for how this works.  The versioned site_perl
directory was introduced in 5.005, so that is the lowest
possible value.  The version list appropriate for the current
system is determined in F<inc_version_list.U>.

	C<XXX> To do:  Since compatibility can depend on compile time

	options (such as bincompat, longlong, F<etc.>) it should
(perhaps) be set by Configure, but currently it isn't.
Currently, we read a hard-wired value from F<patchlevel.h>.
Perhaps what we ought to do is take the hard-wired value from
F<patchlevel.h> but then modify it if the current Configure
options warrant.  F<patchlevel.h> then would use an #ifdef guard.

=item C<api_subversion>

From F<patchlevel.U>:

The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
such as F<5.6.1>, api_subversion is the C<1>.  See api_revision for
full details.

=item C<api_version>

From F<patchlevel.U>:

The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
such as F<5.6.1>, api_version is the C<6>.  See api_revision for
full details.  As a special case, 5.5.0 is rendered in the
old-style as 5.005.  (In the 5.005_0x maintenance series,
this was the only versioned directory in $F<sitelib.>)

=item C<api_versionstring>

From F<patchlevel.U>:

This variable combines api_revision, api_version, and
api_subversion in a format such as 5.6.1 (or 5_6_1) suitable
for use as a directory name.  This is filesystem dependent.

=item C<ar>

From F<Loc.U>:

This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
full pathname (if any) of the ar program.  After Configure runs,
the value is reset to a plain C<ar> and is not useful.

=item C<archlib>

From F<archlib.U>:

This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
to put architecture-dependent public library files for $package.
It is most often a local directory such as F</usr/local/lib>.
Programs using this variable must be prepared to deal
with filename expansion.

=item C<archlibexp>

From F<archlib.U>:

This variable is the same as the archlib variable, but is
filename expanded at configuration time, for convenient use.

=item C<archname64>

From F<use64bits.U>:

This variable is used for the 64-bitness part of $archname.

=item C<archname>

From F<archname.U>:

This variable is a short name to characterize the current
architecture.  It is used mainly to construct the default archlib.

=item C<archobjs>

From F<Unix.U>:

This variable defines any additional objects that must be linked
in with the program on this architecture.  On unix, it is usually
empty.  It is typically used to include emulations of unix calls
or other facilities.  For perl on F<OS/2>, for example, this would
include F<os2/os2.obj>.

=item C<awk>

From F<Loc.U>:

This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
full pathname (if any) of the awk program.  After Configure runs,
the value is reset to a plain C<awk> and is not useful.

=back

=head2 b

=over

=item C<baserev>

From F<baserev.U>:

The base revision level of this package, from the F<.package> file.

=item C<bash>

From F<Loc.U>:

This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

=item C<bin>

From F<bin.U>:

This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
to put publicly executable images for the package in question.  It
is most often a local directory such as F</usr/local/bin>. Programs using
this variable must be prepared to deal with F<~name> substitution.

=item C<bincompat5005>

From F<bincompat5005.U>:

This variable contains y if this version of Perl should be
binary-compatible with Perl 5.005.

=item C<binexp>

From F<bin.U>:

This is the same as the bin variable, but is filename expanded at
configuration time, for use in your makefiles.

=item C<bison>

From F<Loc.U>:

This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

=item C<byacc>

From F<Loc.U>:

This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
full pathname (if any) of the byacc program.  After Configure runs,
the value is reset to a plain C<byacc> and is not useful.

=item C<byteorder>

From F<byteorder.U>:

This variable holds the byte order. In the following, larger digits
indicate more significance.  The variable byteorder is either 4321
on a big-endian machine, or 1234 on a little-endian, or 87654321
on a Cray ... or 3412 with weird order !

=back

=head2 c

=over

=item C<c>

From F<n.U>:

This variable contains the \c string if that is what causes the echo
command to suppress newline.  Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is
$echo $n "prompt for a question: $c".

=item C<castflags>

From F<d_castneg.U>:

This variable contains a flag that precise difficulties the
compiler has casting odd floating values to unsigned long:
0 = ok
1 = couldn't cast < 0
2 = couldn't cast >= 0x80000000
4 = couldn't cast in argument expression list

=item C<cat>

From F<Loc.U>:

This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
full pathname (if any) of the cat program.  After Configure runs,
the value is reset to a plain C<cat> and is not useful.

=item C<cc>

From F<cc.U>:

This variable holds the name of a command to execute a C compiler which
can resolve multiple global references that happen to have the same
name.  Usual values are C<cc> and C<gcc>.
Fervent C<ANSI> compilers may be called C<c89>.  C<AIX> has xlc.

=item C<cccdlflags>

From F<dlsrc.U>:

This variable contains any special flags that might need to be
passed with C<cc -c> to compile modules to be used to create a shared
library that will be used for dynamic loading.  For hpux, this
should be +z.  It is up to the makefile to use it.

=item C<ccdlflags>

From F<dlsrc.U>:

This variable contains any special flags that might need to be
passed to cc to link with a shared library for dynamic loading.
It is up to the makefile to use it.  For sunos 4.1, it should
be empty.

=item C<ccflags>

From F<ccflags.U>:

This variable contains any additional C compiler flags desired by
the user.  It is up to the Makefile to use this.

=item C<ccflags_uselargefiles>

From F<uselfs.U>:

This variable contains the compiler flags needed by large file builds
and added to ccflags by hints files.

=item C<ccname>

From F<Checkcc.U>:

This can set either by hints files or by Configure.  If using
gcc, this is gcc, and if not, usually equal to cc, unimpressive, no?
Some platforms, however, make good use of this by storing the
flavor of the C compiler being used here.  For example if using
the Sun WorkShop suite, ccname will be C<workshop>.

=item C<ccsymbols>

From F<Cppsym.U>:

The variable contains the symbols defined by the C compiler alone.
The symbols defined by cpp or by cc when it calls cpp are not in
this list, see cppsymbols and cppccsymbols.
The list is a space-separated list of symbol=value tokens.

=item C<ccversion>

From F<Checkcc.U>:

This can set either by hints files or by Configure.  If using
a (non-gcc) vendor cc, this variable may contain a version for
the compiler.

=item C<cf_by>

From F<cf_who.U>:

Login name of the person who ran the Configure script and answered the
questions. This is used to tag both F<config.sh> and F<config_h.SH>.

=item C<cf_email>

From F<cf_email.U>:

Electronic mail address of the person who ran Configure. This can be
used by units that require the user's e-mail, like F<MailList.U>.

=item C<cf_time>

From F<cf_who.U>:

Holds the output of the C<date> command when the configuration file was
produced. This is used to tag both F<config.sh> and F<config_h.SH>.

=item C<charsize>

From F<charsize.U>:

This variable contains the value of the C<CHARSIZE> symbol, which
indicates to the C program how many bytes there are in a character.

=item C<chgrp>

From F<Loc.U>:

This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

=item C<chmod>

From F<Loc.U>:

This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

=item C<chown>

From F<Loc.U>:

This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

=item C<clocktype>

From F<d_times.U>:

This variable holds the type returned by times(). It can be long,
or clock_t on C<BSD> sites (in which case <sys/types.h> should be
included).

=item C<comm>

From F<Loc.U>:

This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
full pathname (if any) of the comm program.  After Configure runs,
the value is reset to a plain C<comm> and is not useful.

should be used in makefiles.

=item C<installbin>

From F<bin.U>:

This variable is the same as binexp unless C<AFS> is running in which case
the user is explicitely prompted for it. This variable should always
be used in your makefiles for maximum portability.

=item C<installman1dir>

From F<man1dir.U>:

This variable is really the same as man1direxp, unless you are using
C<AFS> in which case it points to the F<read/write> location whereas

portability, you should only use this variable within your makefiles.

=item C<installman3dir>

=item C<installstyle>

From F<installstyle.U>:

This variable describes the C<style> of the perl installation.
This is intended to be useful for tools that need to
manipulate entire perl distributions.  Perl itself doesn't use
this to find its libraries -- the library directories are
stored directly in F<Config.pm>.  Currently, there are only two
styles:  C<lib> and F<lib/perl5>.  The default library locations
(e.g. privlib, sitelib) are either $F<prefix/lib> or
$F<prefix/lib/perl5>.  The former is useful if $prefix is a
directory dedicated to perl (e.g. F</opt/perl>), while the latter
is useful if $prefix is shared by many packages, e.g. if
$prefix=F</usr/local>.

	This may later be extended to include other information, so

	be careful with pattern-matching on the results.

	For compatibility with F<perl5.005> and earlier, the default

	setting is based on whether or not $prefix contains the string
C<perl>.

=item C<n>

From F<n.U>:

This variable contains the C<-n> flag if that is what causes the echo
command to suppress newline.  Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is
$echo $n "prompt for a question: $c".

=item C<need_va_copy>

From F<need_va_copy.U>:

This symbol, if defined, indicates that the system stores
the variable argument list datatype, va_list, in a format
that cannot be copied by simple assignment, so that some
other means must be used when copying is required.
As such systems vary in their provision (or non-provision)
of copying mechanisms, F<handy.h> defines a platform-
C<independent> macro, Perl_va_copy(src, dst), to do the job.

=item C<netdb_hlen_type>

to work on a shared library but that can not be used on an
archive library.  Currently, this is only used by Linux, where
nm --dynamic is *required* to get symbols from an C<ELF> library which
has been stripped, but nm --dynamic is *fatal* on an archive library.
Maybe Linux should just always set usenm=false.

=item C<osvers>

From F<Oldconfig.U>:

This variable contains the operating system version (e.g.
4.1.3, 5.2, F<etc.>).  It is primarily used for helping select
an appropriate hints file, but might be useful elsewhere for
setting defaults.  It is set to '' if we can't figure it out.
We try to be flexible about how much of the version number
to keep, e.g. if 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and 4.1.3 are essentially the
same for this package, hints files might just be F<os_4.0> or
F<os_4.1>, F<etc.>, not keeping separate files for each little release.

=item C<otherlibdirs>

From F<otherlibdirs.U>:

This variable contains a colon-separated set of paths for the perl
binary to search for additional library files or modules.
These directories will be tacked to the end of @C<INC>.
Perl will automatically search below each path for version-

for more details.
A value of C< > means C<none> and is used to preserve this value
for the next run through Configure.

machines, like the mips.  Usually, it should be empty.

=item C<pm_apiversion>

From F<xs_apiversion.U>:

This variable contains the version of the oldest perl
compatible with the present perl.  (That is, pure perl modules
written for $pm_apiversion will still work for the current
version).  F<perl.c>:incpush() and F<lib/lib.pm> will automatically
search in $sitelib for older directories across major versions
back to pm_apiversion.  This is only useful if you have a perl
library directory tree structured like the default one.  The
versioned site_perl library was introduced in 5.005, so that's
the default setting for this variable.  It's hard to imagine
it changing before Perl6.  It is included here for symmetry
with xs_apiveprsion -- the searching algorithms will
(presumably) be similar.
See the C<INSTALL> file for how this works.

=item C<pmake>

From F<Loc.U>:

This variable is defined but not used by Configure.

From F<nblock_io.U>:

This variable holds the return code from read() when no data is
present. It should be -1, but some systems return 0 when C<O_NDELAY> is
used, which is a shame because you cannot make the difference between
no data and an F<EOF.>. Sigh!

=item C<revision>

This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
to put publicly scripts for the package in question.  It is either
the same directory as for binaries, or a special one that can be
mounted across different architectures, like F</usr/share>. Programs
must be prepared to deal with F<~name> expansion.

on this system to execute Bourne shell scripts.  Usually, this will be
F</bin/sh>, though it's possible that some systems will have F</bin/ksh>,
F</bin/pdksh>, F</bin/ash>, F</bin/bash>, or even something such as
D:F</bin/sh.exe>.
This unit comes before F<Options.U>, so you can't set sh with a C<-D>
option, though you can override this (and startsh)
with C<-O -Dsh=F</bin/whatever> -Dstartsh=whatever>

indicates to the C program how many bytes there are in a short.

=item C<shrpenv>

From F<libperl.U>:

If the user builds a shared F<libperl.so>, then we need to tell the
C<perl> executable where it will be able to find the installed F<libperl.so>. 
One way to do this on some systems is to set the environment variable
C<LD_RUN_PATH> to the directory that will be the final location of the
shared F<libperl.so>.  The makefile can use this with something like
$shrpenv $(C<CC>) -o perl F<perlmain.o> $libperl $libs
Typical values are
shrpenv="env C<LD_RUN_PATH>=$F<archlibexp/C<CORE>>"
or
shrpenv=''
See the main perl F<Makefile.SH> for actual working usage.
Alternatively, we might be able to use a command line option such
as -R $F<archlibexp/C<CORE>> (Solaris, NetBSD) or -Wl,-rpath
$F<archlibexp/C<CORE>> (Linux).

From F<versiononly.U>:

If set, this symbol indicates that only the version-specific
components of a perl installation should be installed.
This may be useful for making a test installation of a new
version without disturbing the existing installation.
Setting versiononly is equivalent to setting installperl's -v option.
In particular, the non-versioned scripts and programs such as
a2p, c2ph, h2xs, pod2*, and perldoc are not installed
(see C<INSTALL> for a more complete list).  Nor are the man
pages installed.
Usually, this is undef.

=item C<xs_apiversion>

From F<xs_apiversion.U>:

This variable contains the version of the oldest perl binary
compatible with the present perl.  F<perl.c>:incpush() and
F<lib/lib.pm> will automatically search in $sitearch for older
directories across major versions back to xs_apiversion.
This is only useful if you have a perl library directory tree
structured like the default one.
See C<INSTALL> for how this works.
The versioned site_perl directory was introduced in 5.005,
so that is the lowest possible value.
Since this can depend on compile time options (such as
bincompat) it is set by Configure.  Other non-default sources
of potential incompatibility, such as multiplicity, threads,
debugging, 64bits, sfio, F<etc.>, are not checked for currently,
though in principle we could go snooping around in old
F<Config.pm> files.
