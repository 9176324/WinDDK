    Summary:
    If NdisMAllocateSharedMemory is called in MiniportInitialize, it should also call NdisWriteErrorLogEntry in case it fails.
    
    Description:
    In general is a good practice to log an error entry in the log, whenever an allocation memory operation is failing.
    Most of the allocation operations happen in the MiniportInitializeEx callback.
    
    Related Rule:
    None
