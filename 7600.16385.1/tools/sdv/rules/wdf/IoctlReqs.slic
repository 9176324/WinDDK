	Summary:  This rule verifies that IOCTL requests are not passed to 
	          inappropriate KMDF request send DDIs.
	
	Rule diagnostics:
	All requests presented to the driver in the EVT_WDF_IO_QUEUE_IO_DEVICE_CONTROL
	callback are guaranteed to be IOCTL requests. Hence these cannot be sent using
	DDIs that are specific to sending read, write, ioctl, etc requests.
