These PREfast examples are intended to be built using the build command 
running in the DDK build environment.

That is:
   prefast build -cZ

Two of the sample files have uninitialized variable warnings that are 
treated as errors by build.   Those errors are present to show some of the
characteristics of PREfast; the errors from build can be ignored (but are
also reported by PREfast).

You can view the results with
   prefast view
