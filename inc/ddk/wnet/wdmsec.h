// SDDL_DEVOBJ_KERNEL_ONLY is an "empty" ACL. User mode code (including
// processes running as system) cannot open the device.
//
// This could be used by a driver creating a raw WDM PDO. The INF would specify
// lighter security settings. Until the INF was processed, the device would
// be nonopenable by user mode code.
//
// Similarly, a legacy driver might use this ACL, and let its install app open
// the device up at runtime to individual users. The install app would update
// the class key with a very target ACL and reload the driver. The empty ACL
// would only kick in only if the driver was loaded without the appropriate
// security applied by the install app.
//
// In all of these cases, the default is strong security, lightened as
// necessary (just like chemistry, where the rule is "add acid to water,
// never water to acid").
//
// Example usage:
//     IoCreateDeviceSecure(..., &SDDL_DEVOBJ_KERNEL_ONLY, &Guid, ...);

//
// SDDL_DEVOBJ_SYS_ALL is similar to SDDL_DEVOBJ_KERNEL_ONLY, except that in

// to open the device for any access.
//
// A legacy driver might use this ACL to start with tight security settings,
// and let its service open the device up at runtime to individual users via
// SetFileSecurity API. In this case, the service would have to be running as
// system.
//
// (Note that the DEVOBJ SDDL strings in this file don't specify any
// inheritance. This is because inheritance isn't a valid concept for things
// behind a device object, like a file. As such, these SDDL strings would have
// to be modified with inheritance tokens like "OICI" to be used for things
// like registry keys or file. See the SDK's documentation on SDDL strings for

  The following SIDs represent *accounts* on the local machine:
  -------------------------------------------------------------

    System ("SY", S-1-5-18, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_LOCAL_SYSTEM_RID)
        The OS itself (including its user mode components.)

    Local Service ("LS", S-1-5-19, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_LOCAL_SERVICE_RID)
        A predefined account for services that presents user credentials for local
        resources and annonymous credentials for network access.
        Available on XP and later.

    Network Service ("NS", S-1-5-20, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_NETWORK_SERVICE_RID)
        A predefined account for services that presents user credentials for local
        resources and the machine ID for network access.
        Available on XP and later.

    (A local *account* for a guest and a default administrator also exist, but
     the corresponding SDDL abbreviations are not supported by this library.
     Use the corresponding group SIDs instead.)



  The following SIDs represent *groups* on the local machine:
  -----------------------------------------------------------

    Administrators ("BA", S-1-5-32-544, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_BUILTIN_DOMAIN_RID:DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_ADMINS)
        The builtin administrators group on the machine. This is not the same
        as the builtin Administrator *account*.

    Builtin users group ("BU", S-1-5-32-545, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_BUILTIN_DOMAIN_RID:DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_USERS)
        Group covering all local user accounts, and users on the domain. 

    Builtin guests group ("BG", S-1-5-32-546, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_BUILTIN_DOMAIN_RID:DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_GUESTS)
        Group covering users logging in using the local or domain guest account.
        This is not the same as the builtin Guest *account*.



  The below SIDs describe the authenticity of the user's identity:
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Authenticated Users ("AU", S-1-5-11, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_AUTHENTICATED_USER_RID)
        Any user recognized by the local machine or by a domain. Note that
        users logged in using the Builtin Guest account are not authenticated.
        However, members of the Guests group with individual accounts on the
        machine or domain are authenticated.

    Anonymous Logged-on User ("AN", S-1-5-7, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_ANONYMOUS_LOGON_RID)
        Any user logged on without an identity, for instance via an anonymous
        network session. Note that users logged in using the Builtin Guest
        account are neither authenticated nor anonymous. Available on XP and
        later.

    World ("WD", S-1-1-0, SECURITY_WORLD_SID_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_WORLD_RID)
        Prior to Windows XP, this SID covers every session: authenticated,
        anonymous, and the Builtin Guest account.

        For Windows XP and later, this SID does not cover anonymous logon
        sessions - only authenticated and the Builtin Guest account.

        Note that untrusted or "restricted" code is also not covered by the
        World SID. See the Restricted Code SID description for more
        information.



  The below SIDs describe how the user logged into the machine:
  -------------------------------------------------------------

    Interactive Users ("IU", S-1-5-4, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_INTERACTIVE_RID)
        Users who initally logged onto the machine "interactively", such as
        local logons and Remote Desktops logons.

    Network Logon User ("NU", S-1-5-2, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_NETWORK_RID)
        Users accessing the machine remotely, without interactive desktop
        access (ie, file sharing or RPC calls).

    Terminal Server Users (---, S-1-5-14, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_TERMINAL_SERVER_RID)
        Interactive Users who *initially* logged onto the machine specifically
        via Terminal Services or Remote Desktop.
        (NOTE: There is currently no SDDL token for this SID. Furthermore, the
        presence of the SID doesn't take into account fast user switching
        either.)



  The below SID deserves special mention:
  ---------------------------------------

    Restricted Code ("RC", S-1-5-12, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_RESTRICTED_CODE_RID)
        This SID is used to control access by untrusted code.

        ACL validation against tokens with RC go through *two* checks, one
        against the token's normal list of SIDs (containing WD for instance),
        and one against a second list (typically containing RC and a subset of
        the original token SIDs). Only if both tests pass is access granted.
        As such, RC actually works in *combination* with other SIDs.

        When RC is paired with WD in an ACL, a *superset* of Everyone
        _including_ untrusted code is described. RC is thus rarely seen in
        ACL's without the WD token.
