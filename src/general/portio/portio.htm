<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">

<p>This generic port I/O device driver sample shows how to reserve I/O ports for a non plug-n-play device with an INF file, and read and
write to it from an user application. </p>

<p>The driver building and installation instructions given here applies to Windows&reg; 2000, XP, and Server 2003.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: This sample provides an example of a minimal driver. Neither it nor its
sample programs are intended for use in a production environment. Rather, they are
intended for educational purposes and as a skeleton driver.</p>

<h3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</h3>

<p>Click the Free Build Environment or Checked Build Environment icon under your 
<b>Development Kits </b> program group to set basic environment variables needed 
by the build utility. </p>

<p>Change to the directory containing the device source code, such as CD
Src\General\Portio. </p>

<p>Run <b>build -ceZ</b>, or use the macro <b>BLD</b>. This behavior invokes the Microsoft
make routines that produce log files called Buildxxx.log, and also Buildxxx.wrn and Buildxxx.err if
there are any warnings or errors. Where xxx stands for <b>fre</B> or <b>chk</b> depending
on the environment chosen. If the build succeeds, the driver Genport.sys and two application
GpdRead.exe and GpdWrite will be placed in a platform specific subdirectory of your
<b>%TargetPath%</b> directory specified in the Sources file.</p>

<h4>Driver Installation </h4>

<p>To install the driver on Windows 2000: 

<ol>
  <li>Double-click the Add New Hardware Wizard applet in Control Panel.</li>
  <li>Click Next.</li>
  <li>Select Add a new device.</li>
  <li>Select No, I Want to Select the Hardware from a list.</li>
  <li>Select Other Devices and then click Next. </li>
  <li>Click Have Disk and point to the directory that contains genport.inf file. Make sure the SYS file is copied under appropriate subdirectory (i386, ia64, amd64).</li>
</ol>

To install the driver on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003: <p>

<OL>

<LI>
      Double-click the ‘Add Hardware’ wizard in Control Panel.

<LI>
      At the 'Welcome to the Add Hardware Wizard', click ‘Next’.

<LI>
      Select 'Yes, I have already connected the hardware', then click Next.
<LI>
      Select ‘Add a new hardware device’ from the list, then click Next.

<LI>
      Select ‘Install the hardware that I manually select from a list(Advanced),' and then click next.

<LI>
      Select ‘Show All Devices’, then click Next. 

<LI>  Click 'Have Disk', make sure that 'A:\' is in the "Copy manufacturer's files from:" box, and click OK.

<LI>  Click on the desired entry, and then click Next.

<LI>  At 'The wizard is ready to install your hardware', click Next.

<LI>  Click Finish at 'Completing the Add/Remove Hardware Wizard.'
 </OL>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the DEVCON.EXE from the DDK to install the driver programmatically.</P>

<B>c:\>DEVCON.EXE   INSTALL   genport.inf   "root\portio"</B>

<p>The system copies the genport.sys file to %systemroot%\system32\drivers directory and
loads the driver. The INF file specifies two logical configuartion for the device.</p>

<p><br>
[PortIO.LC0]<br>
ConfigPriority=DESIRED <br>
IOConfig=300-303(3ff::) ; 10 bit decode ranging from 300 - 303<br>
<br>
[PortIO.LC1]<br>
ConfigPriority=NORMAL<br>
IOConfig=4@300-3ff(3ff::) ; 4 ports starting anywhere between 300 and 3fc<br>
</p>

<p>The system will first try to assing the DESIRED configuration. If there is conflict
then it will try to assign any 4 consecutive ports between 300 and 3fc as specified in the
LC1 configuration. Please note that priorities "NORMAL", "DESIRED", and "SUBOPTIMAL" imply 
that the device can be software reconfigured and so will accept the factory defaults. 
"HARDRECONFIG" means that the user has to manually change the 	jumper settings on the board, 
so the system will prompt user to select the resources during install.
</p>

<h3>TOOLS</h3>

<p>To test your GENPORT driver, do the following.</p>

<p>GpdRead -b 1 {This reads a byte from assingned 'base port address + 1' } </p>

<p>GpdWrite -b 2 1 {This writes 1 to assigned 'base port address + 2' } </p>
