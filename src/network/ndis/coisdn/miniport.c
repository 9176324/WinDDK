@func

    <f DriverEntry> is called by the operating system when a driver is loaded.
    This function creates an association between the miniport NIC driver and
    the NDIS library and registers the miniport's characteristics with NDIS.

    DriverEntry calls NdisMInitializeWrapper and then NdisMRegisterMiniport.
    DriverEntry passes both pointers it received to NdisMInitializeWrapper,
    which returns a wrapper handle.  DriverEntry passes the wrapper handle to
    NdisMRegisterMiniport.

    The registry contains data that is persistent across system boots, as well
    as configuration information generated anew at each system boot.  During
    driver installation, data describing the driver and the NIC is stored in
    the registry. The registry contains adapter characteristics that are read
    by the NIC driver to initialize itself and the NIC. See the Kernel-Mode
    Driver Design Guide for more about the registry and the Programmer's Guide
    for more information about the .inf files that install the driver and
    write to the registry.

@comm

    Every miniport driver must provide a function called DriverEntry.  By
    convention, DriverEntry is the entry point address for a driver.  If a
    driver does not use the name DriverEntry, the driver developer must define
    the name of its entry function to the linker so that the entry point
    address can be known into the OS loader.

    It is interesting to note, that at the time DriverEntry is called, the OS
    doesn't know that the driver is an NDIS driver.  The OS thinks it is just
    another driver being loaded.  So it is possible to do anything any driver
    might do at this point.  Since NDIS is the one who requested this driver
    to be loaded, it would be polite to register with the NDIS wrapper.  But
    you can also hook into other OS functions to use and provide interfaces
    outside the NDIS wrapper.  (Not recommended for the faint of heart).

@comm

    The parameters passed to DriverEntry are OS specific! NT passes in valid
    values, but Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 just pass in zeros.  We don't
    care, because we just pass them to the NDIS wrapper anyway.

@rdesc

    <f DriverEntry> returns zero if it is successful.<nl>
    Otherwise, a non-zero return value indicates an error condition.

@func

    <f MiniportInitialize> is a required function that sets up a NIC (or
    virtual NIC) for network I/O operations, claims all hardware resources
    necessary to the NIC in the registry, and allocates resources the driver
    needs to carry out network I/O operations.

@comm

    No other outstanding requests to the miniport driver are possible when
    MiniportInitialize is called. No other request is submitted to the
    miniport driver until initialization is completed.

    The NDIS library supplies an array of supported media types. The miniport
    driver reads this array and provides the index of the media type that the
    NDIS library should use with this miniport driver. If the miniport driver
    is emulating a media type, its emulation must be transparent to the NDIS
    library.

    MiniportInitialize must call NdisMSetAttributes in order to return
    MiniportAdapterContext.

    If the miniport driver cannot find a common media type supported by both
    itself and the NDIS library, it should return
    NDIS_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA.

    If NDIS_STATUS_OPEN_ERROR is returned, the NDIS wrapper can examine the
    output parameter OpenErrorStatus to obtain more information about the
    error.

    MiniportInitialize is called with interrupts enabled. MiniportISR is
    called if the NIC generates any interrupts. The NDIS library will not call
    MiniportDisableInterrupt and MiniportEnableInterrupt during the
    MiniportInitialize function, so it is the responsibility of the miniport
    driver to acknowledge and clear any interrupts generated.

@rdesc

    <f MiniportInitialize> returns zero if it is successful.<nl>
    Otherwise, a non-zero return value indicates an error condition.

@func

    <f MiniportShutdown> is an optional function that restores a NIC to its
    initial state when the system is shut down, whether by the user or because
    an unrecoverable system error occurred.

@comm

    Every NIC driver should have a <f MiniportShutdown> function.
    <f MiniportShutdown> does nothing more than restore the NIC to its initial
    state (before the miniport's DriverEntry function runs). However, this
    ensures that the NIC is in a known state and ready to be reinitialized
    when the machine is rebooted after a system shutdown occurs for any
    reason, including a crash dump.

    A NIC driver's MiniportInitialize function must call
    NdisMRegisterAdapterShutdownHandler to set up a <f MiniportShutdown>
    function. The driver's MiniportHalt function must make a reciprocal call
    to NdisMDeregisterAdapterShutdownHandler.

    If <f MiniportShutdown> is called due to a user-initiated system shutdown,
    it runs at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL in a system-thread context. If it is called
    due to an unrecoverable error, <f MiniportShutdown> runs at an arbitrary
    IRQL and in the context of whatever component raised the error. For
    example, <f MiniportShutdown> might be run at high DIRQL in the context of
    an ISR for a device essential to continued execution of the system.

    <f MiniportShutdown> should call no NdisXxx functions.

@func

    <f MiniportReset> request instructs the Miniport to issue a hardware
    reset to the network adapter.  The Miniport also resets its software
    state.

    The <F MiniportReset> request may also reset the parameters of the adapter.
    If a hardware reset of the adapter resets the current station address
    to a value other than what it is currently configured to, the Miniport
    driver automatically restores the current station address following the
    reset.  Any multicast or functional addressing masks reset by the
    hardware do not have to be reprogrammed by the Miniport.

    <f Note>: This is change from the NDIS 3.0 driver specification.  If the
    multicast or functional addressing information, the packet filter, the
    lookahead size, and so on, needs to be restored, the Miniport indicates
    this with setting the flag AddressingReset to TRUE.

    It is not necessary for the Miniport to complete all outstanding requests
    and no other requests will be submitted to the Miniport until the
    operation is completed.  Also, the Miniport does not have to signal
    the beginning and ending of the reset with NdisMIndicateStatus.

    <f Note>: These are different than the NDIS 3.0 driver specification.

    The Miniport must complete the original request, if the orginal
    call to <F MiniportReset> return NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, by calling
    NdisMResetComplete.

    If the underlying hardware does not provide a reset function under
    software control, then this request completes abnormally with
    NDIS_STATUS_NOT_RESETTABLE.  If the underlying hardware attempts a
    reset and finds recoverable errors, the request completes successfully
    with NDIS_STATUS_SOFT_ERRORS.  If the underlying hardware resets and,
    in the process, finds nonrecoverable errors, the request completes
    successfully with the status NDIS_STATUS_HARD_ERRORS.  If the
    underlying  hardware reset is accomplished without any errors,
    the request completes successfully with the status NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS.

    Interrupts are in any state during this call.

@comm

    I have only seen MiniportReset called when the driver is not working
    properly.  If this gets called, your code is probably broken, so fix
    it.  Don't try to recover here unless there is some hardware/firmware
    problem you must work around.

@rdesc

    <f MiniportReset> returns zero if it is successful.<nl>
    Otherwise, a non-zero return value indicates an error condition.
