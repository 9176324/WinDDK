Hardware Driver Sample</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<p align="left">The Philips Europa&nbsp; PCI board is a TV Tuner/Video Capture 
reference design board based on the Philips SAA7134 PCI video/stereo decoder 
chip. It does PAL (Analog TV), DVB-T (Digital TV) and captures NTSC and PAL 
through its SVideo/Composite Inputs. Based on this functionality the driver 
exposes the standard filters for Analog TV, Digital TV and Video Capture. This 
sample demonstrates how to write&nbsp; BDA/AVStream drivers for TV Tuner cards 
and AVStream&nbsp; drivers for video capture cards in general.</p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4">Building and Installing the Sample Driver</font></b></p>
<p align="left">
This sample builds and functions&nbsp;in i386 and&nbsp;amd64 platforms.&nbsp;It 
installs and works on all Windows systems starting from Windows 98 Gold 
provided DirectX 9.0&nbsp; (or some equivalent) is installed on the system.</p>
<p align="left">Run "build -cZ" from the europa directory. This should build the 
driver binary <i>34bdacap.sys</i> and the coinstaller <i>34coinstaller.dll</i>. 
The&nbsp;INF file&nbsp;used to install the driver is <EM>34avstrm.inf </EM>(<EM>34avstrm_w2k.inf
</EM>for Windows 2000 and Windows 9x).&nbsp; The source files are arranged in 
five directories : <i>src</i> (which contains the actual AVStream driver 
sources), <i>inc</i> (the headers for the AVStream driver), <i>coinstaller </i>(which 
contains the coinstaller sources for Europa installation),<i> hal</i> (which 
contains the headers and a lib file for the card's HAL) and <i>lib</i> (which 
contains the headers and a lib file specific to the board - these call into the 
HAL). <EM>34hal.lib</EM> and <EM>34kmproxy.lib </EM>areboth required to build 
the sample but&nbsp;distributed in binary form only. The coinstaller makes sure 
that the driver can be installed only if DirectX version 9.0 or higher is 
installed on the system. If DirectX 9.0 (or&nbsp;some equivalent) is not 
installed on the system, the coinstaller fails the install with an error 
message indicating "Bad Environment".</p>
<p align="left">To install the driver, point the hardware wizard to a directory 
containing the files <i>34avstrm.inf</i>, <i>34bdacap.sys and 34coinstaller.dll</i>. 
Use <EM>34avstrm_w2k.inf</EM> instead <EM>34avstrm.inf</EM> on Windows 2000 and 
Windows 9x systems. On XP and higher systems you shouldn't need to reboot in 
order to install or reinstall the driver.</p>
<P align="left">The driver needs to be built separately for the 1316 and 1344 tuner 
boards. The tuner type defaults to 1316, and this can be changed 
by&nbsp;changing&nbsp;a compiler flag in the&nbsp;sources file. Change -DTD1316 
in the sources file&nbsp;to -DTD1344.</P>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4">Graph Building</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><i>To build a digital TV graph</i> insert the DVBT Network 
Provider, the Europa BDA Tuner (from the BDA Source Filters category) and the 
Europa BDA Digital Capture (BDA Receiver Components). Make sure there is a 
tuning space called "DVBT". If not create one using the DVBT network provider 
proppage and then right click, render the pin on the network provider. This 
should build the entire graph pulling up required filters like the Transport 
Information Filter, the MPEG2 Demultiplexer and the audio/video decoders. In 
order to use the network provider property pages you will need to register 
proppage.dll. Also when first creating a tuning space do a submit tune request 
as well. In the absence of a tuning space the graph will not build.</p>
<p align="left"><i>To build an Analog TV graph </i>insert the "Europa Analog Tuner" 
(from the WDM Streaming TV Tuner Devices category), the "Europa Analog TV 
Audio" filter (WDM Streaming TV Audio), the "Europa BDA Crossbar Filter" (WDM 
Streaming Crossbar Devices) and the "Europa BDA Analog Capture" filter (WDM 
Streaming Capture Devices). After this build and run an Analog TV graph in the 
usual manner.
</p>
<p align="left"><i>To build a Video Capture graph</i> follow the instructions for 
Analog TV - but you can dispense with the the tuner and tv audio filters. Set 
the crossbar properties appropriately for S-Video and Composite Inputs and the 
corresponding audio line-in. You will need to manually insert the CC/WST and 
Line 21 Decoder filters for Closed Captioning / Teletext.
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Notes</b></font></p>
<P align="left">1. The dgtl* files deal with Digital TV and the anlg* deal with 
Analog TV and Video Capture related filters, pins and formats. The vamp* files 
refer to the VampDevice which is a layer of abstraction between the driver and 
the hardware.</P>
<p align="left">2. Europa has a line-in for audio capture as well. Correspondingly, 
the Analog Capture Filter has an Audio Out pin that produces Wave Format (PCM) 
Audio.</p>
