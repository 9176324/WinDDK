  <h3 align="left"><span style="font-family:Verdana">What is ACPI Stress? And How Do I Use It?</span></h3>
  <h3><span style="font-family:Verdana">Summary</span></h3>
  <p><font face="Verdana">ACPI Stress is a suite of stress 
  tests that are designed to exercise each possible sleep state the system 
  supports and each sleep state individual devices support.&nbsp; Before and 
  after each sleep cycle the devices in the system are tested for functionality 
  through Win32 interfaces and also through standard methods like accessing the 
  disk or pinging various machines on the network.&nbsp; During this testing if 
  a device node is found to be having a problem or if at some point something 
  hangs a particular test due to the device not powered anymore or the device 
  just stops working then ACPI Stress can break into the attached kernel debugger so 
  the issue can then be debugged.<br><br>
  Note: ACPI Stress works only with Windows 2000 and Windows XP.<br>

  <h3><font face="Verdana">Using ACPI Stress</font></h3>
  <p><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  There are two methods to launching PMTE.&nbsp; The first method is by using 
  the batch file called pmteauto.bat and the second method is to manually launch 
  pmte.exe.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
  <h4><span style="font-family: Verdana"><b>1.&nbsp; Using the batch file called 
  &quot;pmteauto.bat&quot;</b></span></h4>
  <p><font face="Verdana">The first method is designed to automate the launching of PMTE where it will 
  test every device on the system will cycling through the support sleeps 
  states.&nbsp; After it has tested every device and every supported sleep state 
  once, it then will repeat this 99 more times.&nbsp; Once that is completed 
  then execute pmteauto.bat which will kick off PMTE to automatically test every 
  device in your system through every sleep state that is reported as being 
  supported.</font></p>

  <p><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
  <blockquote>
  <h4><span style="font-family: Verdana">2.&nbsp; Manually launching pmte.exe&nbsp;</span></h4>
  <p><span style="font-family: Verdana">The second method is to allow you to have full control over how PMTE executes.&nbsp; 
  To launch PMTE execute pmte.exe in the %ddkroot%\tools\pmte folder.&nbsp; At 
  this point you should be presented with a dialog box.&nbsp; In this dialog box 
  you will be presented with three tabs labeled “Device to Test”, “Script Run” 
  and “Advanced”.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Verdana">In the “Device to Test” tab all of the 
  device that are to be tested is selected.&nbsp; If you don’t want to run this 
  test against a specific device then deselect the device.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Verdana">In the “Script Run” tab you can select the scripts that are available to use.&nbsp; 
  You can then set how long you want run PMTE by specifying how longs in days, 
  hours, and minutes or by how many days and until which time or by how many 
  cycles to cycle through.&nbsp; Here you can also specify which sleep states 
  you do not want to test perhaps to knowing about some specific bug that exists 
  at a particular sleep state.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Verdana">Finally in the “Advanced” tab you can modify several different types of 
  settings.&nbsp; You can have the hard disk spin down after x number of 
  minutes.&nbsp; You can instruct PMTE to use the reset option after hibernate 
  to help automate hibernate testing on machines that don’t support an RTC wake 
  from S4.&nbsp; You can have PMTE ignore any reported RTC capabilities.&nbsp; 
  You can also specify which network share to test the network I/O against in 
  case you want to make sure it can reach a share that exists.&nbsp; If a 
  network share is not specified then a “net view” is done and any systems found 
  are pinged to test network functionality found.&nbsp; And finally on Windows 
  2000 you can have control what PMTE will do when a test instance hangs.&nbsp; 
  You can have it break into the debugger, or terminate the test process or just 
  ignore that test.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Verdana">O</span><font face="Verdana">nce you have configured PMTE to run the way you want 
  it to run just click on ok and it will start up with the parameters you 
  provided it.</font></p>
