What does MCStream do
=========================

	MCStream is a MFC based app that allows the user to generate and render multiple channel wave tones.  
The user has the ability to specify the audible frequency of each channel, to select the sample rate, bit depth and speaker configuration, to select a suitable device and to render the generated tone. The tone is in WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE format and the dialog displays the value of each attribute.


How to build the sample
=========================
	Install the DDK, run setenv.bat and then run nmake.exe in this directory.


How to run the sample
=========================

	- Run MCStream.exe. 
	- Specify an audio frequency (between 50 and 20,000 Hz), select an available speaker and click the 'Add' button to add a single channel tone to the mix.
	- Select various devices that support the current format.
	- Select different values for the bit depth and sample rate fields; the related fields will be updated.
	- Render the current mix.
	- Remove one or all of the single channel tones by clicking on the respective buttons.
