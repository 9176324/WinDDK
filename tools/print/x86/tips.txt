You can obtain help by using the Help menu, by clicking the question mark on the toolbar, or by pressing the F1 key.

Context menus are available for items within the workspace of a minidriver's Component View,as well as for many items within the Unidrv Font Metrics (UFM) and glyph translation table (GTT) editors. To view a context menu, place the mouse cursor over the item, and then click the right mouse button.

You can rename a workspace, or any of the files within it, by changing the name within the workspace's Component View. To rename an item, place the mouse cursor over the item,and then click the right mouse button to display the context menu.

Adding or removing code points in a glyph translation table (GTT) invalidates the width information for variable-pitch fonts that use the table. Adding or removing code points might make the font unusable, because font widths are stored in UFM files by index into the GTT, and not by Unicode code point.

When you use the GTT editor, be careful when you change the selected code page for a code point. The editor does not verify that the code point is defined in the new code page.

In the Add Code Points dialog box, you can select and add a single code point, or you can simultaneously select and add multiple code points.

Lists of items in columns can be sorted by column, if the column has a title box. To sort by column,click the title box for the column. To reverse the list order, click the title box again. 

Font selection strings are represented in C-language string literal format, except that the octal escape (\nnn) is not allowed.

To view lists of code pages installed on your system and code pages that Microsoft Windows NT supports, select About from the Help menu.

You can edit a UFM, GTT, or Generic Printer Description (GPD) file by opening it in Microsoft Windows NT xplorer.

When you move a GPD file from one workspace to another, you must delete the GPD file from the first workspace.

The Conversion Wizard sets the capital H height and lowercase X height of the font to 0. GDI calculates default values.

Win16 minidrivers require you to define encodings for a continuous range of characters, so duplicate encodings of the default character set often exist. You can save space and time by removing the duplicates from your GTT files.  To quickly find the duplicates, sort the code points by clicking the Selection String column title in the GTT editor. Then, delete the duplicates with the Delete key.

You can use the workspace to change where a GPD file is saved. To do so, move the mouse cursor over the name of the GPD file in the Component View for the workspace. Click the right mouse button, and then click the Rename option. The file path displays, which you can edit. When you subsequently click Save, Close, or Exit from the File menu, the GPD file is moved.
